IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a extensive mechanical excision of endobronchial tissue to salvage the airway as well as two separate stent placement given abarrent anatomy. This resulted in >80% increased work due to Technical difficulty of procedure and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). Pt with complex airway with significant stenosis of the LMSB and complete occlusion of the LLL bronchus that required multiple attempts and 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
An iGel was placed by anesthesia after adequate sedation.
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Left Mainstem, Carina, LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. The stent was partially occluded with thick yellow,green mucus
The LUL bronchus was approximately 3-4 mm and the LLL bronchus could not be visualized. Saline was instilled without visualization of the LLL.  
Endobronchial tumor was noted and required extensive excision and mechanical debridement.  (Alligator forceps) and 1.7 cryoprobe with 30 second freeze cycles to vascular occlusion and then cryotherapy for further debulking of the LUL ostium.
It appeared that the LMSB stent migrated distally and appeared to be covering the LMSB
Using forceps the proximal end of the microtech stent was grasped and then removed on en bloc with the bronchoscope. The foreign body removal was difficult due to significant inflammation.
After removal the LMSB mucosa was ragged, irregular and there was dynamic collapse. The LLL bronchus could not be visualized and the LC2 was difficult to delineate along the inferior portion. The area of firm and unable to use multiple aliquots the LLL airway could not be identified. 
Due to complex anatomy a jag wire was placed in the Lingula and the radial EBUS was utilized to identify vasculature and airways but the LLL was still unable to be identified.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- LUL BAL - cell count, culture and cytology
- LMSB EBBx - pathology 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 68 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial stenosis. Very odd presentation of cicatrization and benign stenosis of the LMSB without evidence of residual malignancy. Very challenging anatomy of the airway and stenosis. Continues to have robust inflammatory response and no additional stents were placed. 
- admit overnight
- start abx to treat MSSA, add prednisone 20 mg and obtain CT chest with contrast
- NPO after midnight for bronchoscopy [REDACTED]

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
  
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Airway noted to be stable with significant airway pressure.  Stent was noted to be migrated distally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Foreign body (stent) was noted in the distal trachea.  BonaStent (14x60) was removed with forceps. 
 
Significant amount of hair was noted and was causing endobronchial obstruction at the level of graft leading to mucus trapping.  These were mechanically removed with forceps (excision of lesion due to obstruction).
 
There were significant granulation tissue that was noted and APC was used to ablate the granulation issue to reduce obstruction. Endobronchial obstruction at Subglottic was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	1.5mm 	Pulse 20 effect 2, flow 0.3	2-3 sec 	ablated
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 60% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID:  note_054 SOURCE_FILE: note_054.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 49 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31502 Tracheotomy tube change prior to establishment of fistula tract
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required wound packing at tracheostomy stoma. This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31502 Tracheotomy tube change prior to establishment of fistula tract. 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Versed             5 mg (total)
Fentanyl          150 mcg (total)
Propofol gtt60mcg/kg/min
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   1338
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   1510
 
Total moderate sedation time was 92 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by ICU RN. 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Diagnostic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Normal.
Larynx: Normal.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE FROM ABOVE
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Subglottic, Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Upper airway was suctioned and cleared.  Endotracheal suctioning performed.  The cuff was deflated and the tracheostomy tube was easily removed.  
 
The stoma appeared widely patent however an erosion was visualized at the 4 o'clock (inferolateral) position.
 
STOMA EROSION
 
The new tracheostomy tube was then placed with obturator in place.  The obturator was removed, inner cannula was placed and the cuff inflated.
 
Percutaneous tracheostomy was changed from:
Shiley cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 7.0mm
 
To Portex cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 7.0mm without issue.
 
During the procedure Cardiothoracic Surgery (Dr Hudson) was consulted as they had placed the original tracheostomy tube. Under their guidance and expertise, the erosion was packed with iodoform gauze.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--RML BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 49 year old-year-old female who presents for tracheostomy tube exchange and bronchoscopy. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and RML BAL. No airway bleeding, oozing, or significant secretions/mucus was appreciated. Tracheostomy tube exchange was performed with removal of of the patient's Shiley 7mm cuffed tube and placement of a Portex 7mm cuffed tube. On inspection of the patient's stoma an erosion was noted at the inferolateral aspect. Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted and they recommended packing with iodoform gauze.
 
--Portex 7mm cuffed tracheostomy tube placed
--Stoma erosion packed with iodoform gauze
--Recommend Wound Care evaluation
--Follow up RML BAL results
--Continued care per primary team
