NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_210 SOURCE_FILE: note_210.txt After pt was induced by Anesthesia and LMA was placed, the OR table was rotated 180 degrees. The diagnostic bronchoscope was introduced and LMA placement was adjusted. Whitish nodules were noted on the right vocal cord. The scope was then passed into the trachea and the central airways were inspected. Moderate purulent secretions were noted at the RUL. The endobronchial mucosa of the RUL was edematous and friable and the apical subsegment bronchus appeared somewhat narrowed as though from extrinsic compression. 

The diagnostic scope was removed and the EBUS scope was introduced. The hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were surveyed and all nodes were measured. The nodes that met criteria for sampling (i.e. >5mm short axis diameter) were then sampled by real time EBUS TBNA in the following order: 4R, 7, 2R, 10R, 11R. 

The EBUS scope was then removed and the diagnostic scope was introduced. Radial probe EBUS was inserted into the RUL apical subsegment until abnormal tissue was identified at approx 4cm from the end of the scope. This area was then biopsied with needle and brush. A BAL was then performed in the RUL. The central airways were inspected to confirm hemostasis and the scope was removed.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_156 SOURCE_FILE: note_156.txt Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy
Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy – single station
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A large, station 7, lymph node was identified and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 22G EBUS-TBNA needles with a total of 7 passes performed. Rapid onsite pathological evaluation showed malignancy. Samples were sent for both flow and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and DECAMP research bronchoscopy was performed with endobronchial forceps biopsy of the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and left upper lobe as well as endobronchial brushing of bronchus intermedius. After suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies and DECAMP research protocol. 
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

NOTE_ID:  note_085 SOURCE_FILE: note_085.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 74 year old-year-old female who presents with hemoptysis after bronchoscopy.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: hemoptysis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  hemoptysis
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
ANESTHESIA: 
Continuous sedation
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: supine
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The bronchoscope was introduced into the ETT. The ETT is 2 cm above the main carina. The bronchial blocker was in the RLL but was mostly deflated without evidence of spill over into the other segments. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LLL and LMSB from mucus. 
The balloon was was fully deflated and then removed. Then a new 7 F Ardnt bronchial blocker was replaced through the existing ETT. The blocker was positioned in the distal BI. 3 mL of air was introduced into the blocker and resulted in occlusion of the BI without occlusion of the RUL. During exchange of the bronchial blocker there was no increase in the blood seen in the RLL lateral segment. This was no aspirated due to no obvious formed clot.
The bronchoscope was removed. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  
SPECIMEN(S): 
none
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 74 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for hemoptysis.
[ ] keep blocker in place at 40 cm at the connective device
[ ] ETT at 20 cm at the front tooth
[ ] stop paralysis once this is not effective stop fentanyl and repeat bronchoscopy at 1500 today
[ ] family updated

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Stent in RML orifice in good position. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	2.3 mm	straight	Pulse effect 4	ablated
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 90% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID:  note_256 SOURCE_FILE: note_256.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial stenosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Radiation induced bronchial stenosis
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Flexible bronchoscopy balloon dilatation 
INDICATIONS: left sided lung collapse and possible bronchial obstruction. 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the operating room. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was normal appearing with minimal mild thick secretions. The bronchoscope was then advanced to the main carina, which was sharp. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Each segment and subsegment within the right upper, right middle, right lower lobe was well visualized. The right sided airway anatomy was normal and no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the left main stem. In the distal mainstem there was circumferential erythema of the airway wall without stenosis. There was purulent secretions in the left upper and lower lobe. Bronchial wash was performed in the left upper lobe for culture.  The left upper lobe airways were not stenotic but had chronic erythematous appearance consistent with radiation changes. The left lower lobe take-off was not stenotic but there was moderate stenosis of the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe and severe stenosis (90%) of the anterior medial segment. No specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the left. Following inspection we removed the diagnostic bronchoscope and introduced the T180 therapeutic bronchoscope. Our attention to the stenosis within the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe and gentle dilatation was performed with the 6mm Elation dilating balloon with mild improvement in stenosis. The airway wall was friable however and oozed easily. We then attempted to gently dilate the anterior-medial segment by bypassing the obstruction and gently inflating the balloon to partial expansion (<6mm) and pull back through the stenosis. When this was done relatively brisk bleeding developed. We then wedged the bronchoscope in the left lower lobe for 2 minutes and reassessed. At that point the bleeding had stopped and we felt that given the distal airway disease (likely radiation induced) and only segmental obstruction, the risk/benefit ratio of continued attempts at dilatation favored abstaining from further intervention. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.  
Recommendations:
- Patient to PACU for recovery
- Await culture results
- Follow-up with primary pulmonologist

INSTRUMENT : 
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level.
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	 	300	12	100	10	15
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2).  Target lesion is about 0.8 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 10 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
Fiducial marker was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
No evidence of a malignant neoplasm

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
No immediate complications
Based upon the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the ultrasound appearance and size, biopsies were not taken.
Site 2: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the ultrasound appearance and size, biopsies were not taken.
Site 3: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the ultrasound appearance and size, biopsies were not taken.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE: note_192

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_192 SOURCE_FILE: note_192.txt Indications: Left upper lobe mass 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11Ri (5.0 mm), and 11Rs(6.6 mm). Additionally the 4L was 4.9 mm but slightly hypoechoic and decision was made to sample this node as well. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus Visioshot 2 EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180  degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, triple needle brush and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. Fluoroscopic inspection was performed and no pneumothorax was visualized at the conclusion of the procedure. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful and biopsy of left upper nodule
- Negative Staging EBUS on preliminary evaluation 
- Await final pathology  
- Post-procedure xray did not show pneumothorax. 
- Patient was noted to be slightly hypoxic post-procedure likely as a result of sedation and decision was made to admit patient for overnight observation.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_086 SOURCE_FILE: note_086.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
PROCEDURE:  
31899 Unlisted Procedure (Trach Change with Mature Tract or Procedure NOS)
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  Sedation initiated.  LMA placed.
The Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope was advanced for airway examination.  Endobronchial topical lidocaine applied to the vocal cords, main carina, right carina 1, and left carina 2.
Initial Airway Examination Findings:
Larynx: Not fully assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Vocal Chords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Mildy tortuous, otherwise normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Right Lung Proximal Airways: The right anastomosis site was intact with visible intact blue sutures at site; mild stenosis of right anastomosis without dehiscence. The RUL and RB1-3 were normal to segmental level. The bronchus intermedius and more distal lobes/airways are mildly rotated clockwise.  The RML bronchus with moderate stenosis - estimate ~5mm patent; unable to traverse with therapeutic bronchoscope.  The RML mucosa has an anthracotic appearance to it.  However, this is overall the best I have seen his RML look before an intervention; no associated granulation tissue.  Able to visualize patent RB5/RB5.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: The left anastomosis site was intact with visible intact blue sutures at site; mild stenosis of left anastomosis. The LUL bronchus and LB1-3 were normal to first subsegmental level. The lingula is patent and LB4-5 are normal to first subsegmental level - able to traverse lingular bronchus with therapeutic bronchoscope. LLL and LB6-10 have normal anatomic branching to segmental level. No other evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology. 
Mucosa: Normal except as described above.
Secretions: Moderate, thin, and clear  All secretions were suctioned to clear (therapeutic aspiration). 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, left lower lobe from mucus. 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at right middle lobe (Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5)).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Residual secretions, saline suctioned to clear.  No bleeding.  Bronchoscope removed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient's LMA was removed in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
SPECIMEN(S): 
RML BAL - cell count, cultures/micro, cytology
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway evaluation and BAL.
-RML bronchus appears overall the best I have seen it at the beginning of the bronchoscopy; no granulation tissue or signs of irritation.  Although unable to traverse with therapeutic bronchoscope, the RB4 and RB5 subsegments are grossly patent.  Therefore, to hopefully avoid undo inflammation, no dilation or other intervention was performed today.
-Repeat bronchoscopy in 2-3 weeks to confirm stability of RML bronchus.  Consideration of interventions depending on appearance of airway.
