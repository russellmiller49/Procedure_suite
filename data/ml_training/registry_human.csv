CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION
The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old [REDACTED] with a history of sub-centimeter lesion. The procedure is indicated based on clinical presentation and imaging findings.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: sub-centimeter lesion

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis pending pathology results

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with biopsy

INFORMED CONSENT
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient demonstrated understanding and provided written informed consent.

ANESTHESIA
Type: MAC
Medications: [REDACTED]
Airway: ETT

PROCEDURE DETAILS
The electromagnetic navigation system was set up and the planning CT was loaded. Registration was performed using the automated pathway. The extended working channel was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS was used to confirm the lesion. Multiple sampling tools were employed including needle, forceps, and brush.

FINDINGS
Electromagnetic navigation performed using Ion system. Target in LLL, 40mm. Registration satisfactory (3.2mm). Radial EBUS showed target. TBBX x4 and brushings obtained.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED
- Multiple biopsies and brushings to pathology
- Specimens labeled with patient identifiers and anatomic location
- Chain of custody maintained

COMPLICATIONS
None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: minimal

DISPOSITION
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. The patient will be discharged home after meeting standard post-procedure criteria.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Navigation-guided biopsy of peripheral lesion completed. Await final pathology.

PLAN
1. CT follow-up if pathology non-diagnostic. Results to tumor board.
2. Results pending; will follow up with pathology
3. Return to clinic in [REDACTED] for follow-up
4. Call for fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis

Airway: LMA

PROCEDURE DETAILS
The EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT/LMA. Systematic examination of the mediastinum was performed. Lymph nodes were identified at multiple stations using ultrasound. Under real-time EBUS guidance, TBNA was performed using a 21-gauge needle. Multiple passes were obtained at each station with rapid on-site evaluation.

FINDINGS
Systematic EBUS staging performed. Stations sampled: 2R (16mm), 10L (16mm), 7 (25mm). ROSE available - 2R positive for adenocarcinoma, others negative for malignancy.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED
- FNA specimens to cytology; cell block prepared
- Specimens labeled with patient identifiers and anatomic location
- Chain of custody maintained

COMPLICATIONS
None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: none

DISPOSITION
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. The patient will be discharged home after meeting standard post-procedure criteria.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Mediastinal/hilar lymph node sampling completed. ROSE results as above; final pathology pending.

PLAN
1. Final pathology in 3-5 days. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion pending.
2. Results pending; will follow up with pathology
3. Return to clinic in [REDACTED] for follow-up
4. Call for fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis

PROCEDURE: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia

INDICATIONS: This is a [REDACTED]-year-old patient with malignant airway obstruction who presents for rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in the supine position. General anesthesia was administered by anesthesia. The bronchoscope was introduced and advanced through the upper airway. A systematic examination was performed. The procedure was completed as planned.

Rigid bronchoscopy revealed exophytic tumor in left mainstem causing 85% obstruction. Tumor debulking performed with electrocautery and mechanical coring. Post-procedure patency improved to 14% obstruction.

The procedure was completed without immediate complication. None

The patient was awakened and transferred to recovery in stable condition.

Bronchoalveolar lavage obtained from LUL with 120 mL instilled and 55 mL return. Fluid appeared milky/turbid. Specimens sent per protocol.

The procedure was completed without immediate complication. None

The patient was awakened and transferred to recovery in stable condition.

SPECIMENS: BAL fluid for cytology, cell count, culture, AFB, fungal

COMPLICATIONS: None

EBL: Minimal

DISPOSITION: Stable to recovery
