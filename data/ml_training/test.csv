PROCEDURE DATE: September 28, 2025
LOCATION: University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA
PROCEDURALIST: Elizabeth Morrison, MD, PhD, FCCP, DABIP
ASSISTANT: Jennifer Lee, DO (IP Fellow, PGY-6)
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Robert Chang, MD, MBA

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule, segment RB9, measuring 2.7 x 2.4 cm on most recent CT imaging dated 09/15/2025, with associated spiculation and pleural tethering highly concerning for malignancy. Previous transthoracic needle biopsy performed on 08/30/2025 yielded diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 positive, confirming primary lung origin.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: As above

PROCEDURE(S) PERFORMED:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy with complete airway survey
2. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with real-time cone-beam CT guidance
3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmation of target lesion
4. Radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe peripheral nodule
5. Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment

CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:
This is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.

DETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:
Following standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.

Anesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.

Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from 09/20/2025 loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) identified and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.

Navigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.

Cone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.

Extended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.

Radiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90°C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation with vital signs: HR 72-85, BP 132/78 - 145/82, SpO2 98-100% on FiO2 0.6. End-tidal CO2 maintained 35-38 mmHg.

After completion of initial 8-minute cycle, probe repositioned 5mm posterior to treat overlapping zone and ensure complete ablation coverage of entire tumor volume plus 5mm margin. Second ablation cycle performed: 6 minutes, target temperature 90°C. Impedance monitoring again demonstrated appropriate curve. Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic changes throughout entire tumor volume consistent with coagulative necrosis. Ice-cream cone appearance of ablation zone well visualized extending beyond original tumor margins.

Guide sheath and EWC slowly withdrawn under direct bronchoscopic visualization. Careful inspection of airways performed showing mild mucosal hyperemia at catheter contact points but no evidence of perforation, significant edema, or active hemorrhage. Small amount of serosanguinous secretions suctioned from right lower lobe, estimated <10 mL total.

Airways irrigated with normal saline. Bronchoscope withdrawn and patient emerged from general anesthesia without complications. Following standard reversal and spontaneous ventilation recovery, patient successfully extubated with good cough and gag reflexes. Transferred to post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition with oxygen saturation 94% on 2L NC.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal, less than 15 milliliters
INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS ADMINISTERED: 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution
SPECIMENS SENT: None

FINDINGS:
1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RLL lateral basal segment target lesion
2. Radiofrequency ablation completed per protocol with two overlapping ablation zones
3. Good real-time monitoring throughout with appropriate impedance and temperature curves
4. Post-ablation imaging demonstrates adequate treatment zone with apparent complete coverage
5. No immediate procedural complications identified

ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

CLINICAL HISTORY & INDICATION
Mrs. Okafor is a 65-year-old Nigerian-American female with a complex medical history including stage IIIB adenocarcinoma of the right lung (diagnosed 04/2023), status post chemoradiation therapy (completed 10/2023). She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:

Right mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung
Malignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)
Right malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells

The patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.
MULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING
Pre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:

Address airway obstruction first (most critical)
Follow with pericardial window creation
Complete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates

INFORMED CONSENT
Extensive discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy) on 10/24/2024 at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:

Bleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)
Perforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)
Arrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)
Hypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)
Need for ICU care postoperatively (expected)
Mortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)

Benefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.
Alternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).
Patient and daughter understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.

"OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE
PART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)
Patient brought to hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:

Correct patient (ID band, verbal confirmation)
Procedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)
Positioning (supine throughout)
Antibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)
Steroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)
Blood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)

Initial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.
Initial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:
Olympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:

Supraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions
Vocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses
Subglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis
Trachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions
Carina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy
Left main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter
LUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent
Right main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.

Decision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.
Rigid Bronchoscopy Phase:
Patient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.
Ventilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.
The rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.
Mechanical Debridement:
Using the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.
Estimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue
Hemostasis Measures:
As expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:

Iced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.
Topical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.
Tranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.

After approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.
Electrocautery:
Flexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.
Treatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus
Treatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time
Effect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis
Argon Plasma Coagulation:
APC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.
Treatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.
Duration: 6 minutes active APC time
Result: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface
Assessment after debridement:
Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.
Balloon Dilation:
Boston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.
Inflation sequence:

First inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Second inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Third inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)

Fluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.
Post-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.
Stent Placement:
After discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.
Stent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length
Deployment technique:

Stent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance
Positioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus
Fluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views
Slow, controlled deployment under direct visualization
Post-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion

Post-stent assessment:
Flexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.
Findings:

Stent well-positioned, no migration
Excellent apposition to airway walls
RUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent
RML orifice: Visible and patent
RLL orifice: Visible and patent
All segments of right lung now visualized for first time
Significant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)

Therapeutic Aspiration:
Extensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:

Right upper lobe: Approximately 30mL
Right middle lobe: Approximately 20mL
Right lower lobe: Approximately 40mL

Total secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.
Final Airway Inspection:

Trachea: Normal
Left bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent
Right main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)
RUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation
Minimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent

Rigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).
Airway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM
Estimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL
Specimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)

PART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)
Patient repositioned with arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.
TEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
Surgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):

Subxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm
Dissection carried down to pericardium
Pericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created
Rush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid
Pericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)
No active bleeding from pericardial surface
19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space
Drain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction

TEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.

PART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)
With patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.
Ultrasound examination (performed by IP team):

Right hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion
Estimated volume: 1000-1200mL
Anechoic fluid, no loculations
Compressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)

PleurX catheter placement:
Standard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Exit site: 5cm anterior. Catheter advanced 15cm into pleural space.
Initial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).
Chest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures. Occlusive dressing applied.

PROCEDURE CONCLUSION
All procedures completed successfully. Total operative time: 4 hours 15 minutes.
Patient Status at Conclusion:

Hemodynamically stable (MAP 78, HR 82)
Improved oxygen saturation: 96% on FiO2 0.5 (compared to pre-procedure 88% on FiO2 1.0)
TEE shows improved cardiac function
Bilateral breath sounds now audible

Patient kept intubated for transport to ICU given length of procedure and concern for post-obstructive pulmonary edema.
Specimens Sent:

Endobronchial tumor (histology)
Bronchial secretions (bacterial, fungal, AFB cultures)
Pericardial tissue (histology, cytology)
Pericardial fluid (cytology, chemistry)
Pleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)

Estimated Total Blood Loss: 250mL
Fluids Given: 2000mL crystalloid
UOP: 400mL
Complications: None intraoperatively

POSTOPERATIVE DISPOSITION & PLAN
Immediate (ICU):

Extubate when fully awake and following commands (anticipated within 2-4 hours)
Chest X-ray immediately post-procedure and daily x3 days
Monitor pericardial drain output
Pleural catheter to drain q3 days initially
Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (started on Pip-Tazo for post-obstructive pneumonia)
DVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ
PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry

Short-term (Inpatient, 3-5 days):

Remove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day
Transition to floor when stable
Continue PleurX catheter drainage
Pain control
Physical therapy for reconditioning

Medium-term (1-2 weeks):

Discharge with home health for PleurX catheter management
Follow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray
Discuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved

Long-term:

Surveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent
Monitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)
May need stent revision/exchange
PleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life


ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
Mrs. Okafor presented with critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:

Near-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction → Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent
Cardiac tamponade physiology → Successfully addressed with pericardial window
Large pleural effusion → Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter

All procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:

Restored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)
Resolution of cardiac compromise
Control of pleural effusion

Prognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.
The patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT
I, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement. I assisted the cardiothoracic surgery team during pericardial window creation.
The procedure was medically necessary, technically indicated, and appropriately performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.

Preoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor
Postoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation (CPT 31641)

Surgeon: Patricia Lee, MD
Assistant: Marcus Johnson, MD
Indications: Tracheal obstruction
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics, the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords, there were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation, resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway. Additionally, there were multiple small polypoid (>50) lesions surrounding and distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1 cm proximal to the main carina. The right-sided and left-sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.

The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions. The lesions, once free from the wall, were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed, about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure, the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.

Of note, we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect as the lesions regrew very quickly (<3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure. However, in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure, he expressed reluctance to have a stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation, and if I need to debulk again, I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.

Recommendations:
• Transfer patient back to ward room
• Await final pathology results
• Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy

I, Patricia Lee, MD, was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure.

"CASE PRESENTATION: Complex Navigation Bronchoscopy

PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS:
A 64-year-old male (Case ID: C-847, Synthetic Name: Martin Lee, MRN: QQ-8473-R, DOB: 05/22/1960) former smoker with 45 pack-year history presented with an incidentally discovered left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule.

IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS:
Computed tomography demonstrated a 17mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe superior segment without clear bronchus sign. Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.

PROCEDURAL APPROACH:
Given the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.

Sedation Protocol:
Deep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.

Technical Details:
The electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension™) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning identified optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.

The extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.

Radiation Exposure:
Total fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes
Dose-area product: 268 cGy·cm²
(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)

Sampling Protocol:
Following tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:
- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)
- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens
- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples

COMPLICATIONS:
Small apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was identified on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.

QUALITY METRICS:
- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved
- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)
- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete
- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology

DISCUSSION:
This case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.","31627,31628,31629,31654",synthetic_notes_with_registry.jsonl,QQ8473R,,False

Attending: Dr. A. Rivera
Assistants: Pulmonary fellow; bronchoscopy RN; radiology technologist.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 18 mm PET-avid right lower lobe posterior basal segment nodule, presumed clinical stage IA non–small cell lung cancer in a nonsurgical candidate.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Parenchyma-sparing local control of early lung cancer via transbronchial microwave ablation.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia, 8.5 mm ETT, ASA III.

Procedures:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (Illumisite platform) with cone-beam CT guidance in a hybrid OR.
2. Radial EBUS confirmation of peripheral lesion position.
3. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right lower lobe nodule using Emprint catheter.

Description: After induction and intubation, a therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced to the right lower lobe. The planning CT was registered on the Illumisite platform; a pathway was generated to the posterior basal segment nodule. Following peripheral navigation, digital tomosynthesis corrected CT-to-body divergence and demonstrated a bullseye view of the lesion. A CrossCountry needle was advanced into the lesion, and an extended working channel (EWC) was positioned 1 cm beyond the nodule center. Radial EBUS showed a concentric hypoechoic lesion. An Emprint microwave catheter was advanced until the ablation center was aligned with the lesion. A single 10-minute ablation using the standard lung protocol was delivered. Post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated a concentric ground-glass ablation zone with a minimal circumferential margin of approximately 6 mm. There was no significant airway bleeding and the segmental bronchi remained patent.

Estimated blood loss: <5 mL.

**DOS:** 03/19/2025
**TEAM:** Dr. Amanda Foster (Attending), Dr. Brian Lee (Fellow), RN Maria Santos, RT Kevin Johnson
**ANESTHESIA:** Dr. Michelle Chang - General/ETT

**INDICATION:**
LLL mass 5.1cm with endobronchial extension + extensive mediastinal/hilar adenopathy. Heavy smoker (80 py). Needs diagnosis and staging.

**PROCEDURES:**
- EBUS-TBNA
- Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy
- Radial EBUS
- Transbronchial biopsies
- Endobronchial biopsies

**CONSENT:** Obtained - all risks discussed

**VENT:** PC mode, Pinsp 20, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%, Pmean 14

**PROCEDURE:**

**PART 1: EBUS-TBNA**

EBUS scope inserted through ETT (8.0, 23cm).

**Mediastinal Survey:**

**Station 2R:** 7mm - not sampled

**Station 4R:** 24mm - hypoechoic, heterogeneous
- 22G needle x 5 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 4L:** 19mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 7:** 28mm - large, hypoechoic, necrotic areas visible
- 22G needle x 5 passes (some passes yielded necrotic material)
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma, areas of necrosis""

**Station 10L:** 22mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 11L:** 18mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 3 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Assessment after EBUS:** Extensive N2/N3 disease. Primary still needs biopsy for confirmation.

**PART 2: AIRWAY INSPECTION**

EBUS scope removed. Standard bronchoscope inserted.

**Finding:** LLL orifice shows endobronchial tumor - exophytic mass nearly occluding orifice, friable appearance.

**Decision:** Obtain endobronchial biopsies directly (easier/safer than navigating to peripheral component).

**Endobronchial biopsies:** 6 specimens obtained from visible LLL tumor using standard forceps.

Moderate bleeding from biopsy site. Managed with:
- Wedging bronchoscope
- Epinephrine 1:10,000, 5mL instilled
- Held position x 2 minutes
- Bleeding resolved

**ROSE (endobronchial):** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples""

**PART 3: EMN TO PERIPHERAL COMPONENT**

Despite endobronchial component, decided to sample peripheral component as well for potentially better tissue for molecular testing.

SuperDimension EMN system used. CT from 03/05/2025 loaded.

**Registration:** Auto-registration, 7 points, adequate accuracy.

**Navigation:** Attempted to navigate to LLL superior segment (peripheral component of mass). However, significant tumor in proximal airway made navigation difficult. Guide advanced as far as possible but unable to reach planned target (remained ~15mm away per system).

**Radial EBUS:** Probe advanced through guide - visualized mass with eccentric pattern but adequate for sampling.

**Peripheral sampling:**
- Forceps biopsies x 5
- Brushings x 2

**ROSE:** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - adequate for molecular testing""

**TOTAL TIME:** 58 minutes

**EXTUBATION:** Uneventful, stable

**EBL:** ~30mL

**SPECIMENS:**
1. Station 4R TBNA x5
2. Station 4L TBNA x4
3. Station 7 TBNA x5
4. Station 10L TBNA x4
5. Station 11L TBNA x3
6. LLL endobronchial tumor biopsies x6
7. LLL peripheral component biopsies x5 (via EMN)
8. LLL brushings x2

**ALL SPECIMENS:** Request PD-L1 testing (relevant for squamous NSCLC treatment decisions)

**COMPLICATIONS:** Moderate endobronchial bleeding - resolved with epinephrine

**FINDINGS:**
- Extensive nodal disease: N2 (stations 4R, 4L, 7) and N3 (contralateral 4L) involvement
- Primary LLL squamous cell carcinoma with endobronchial extension
- Stage: At least IIIB (T3-4N3M0)

**PLAN:**
- Complete staging: Brain MRI
- Not surgical candidate due to extent of nodal disease
- Medical oncology consult - definitive chemoradiation vs clinical trial
- PD-L1 results may influence systemic therapy choice
- F/u 1 week IP clinic

Post-op CXR: No PTX

After completing EBUS, the EBUS bronchoscope was removed.

A standard therapeutic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) was introduced through the ETT for EMN bronchoscopy.

**Standard Bronchoscopy - Airway Survey:**

Detailed inspection of tracheobronchial tree:

*Right lung:*
- Right upper lobe: Anterior, apical, and posterior segments - all patent
- Right middle lobe: Medial and lateral segments - patent
- Right lower lobe: Superior, medial basal, anterior basal, lateral basal, posterior basal segments - all patent
- No endobronchial lesions identified

*Left lung:*
- Left upper lobe: Apical-posterior segment - patent
- Left upper lobe: Anterior segment - patent
- Lingula: Superior and inferior segments - patent
- Left lower lobe: Superior segment - patent
- **Left lower lobe: Basilar segments (medial/anterior/lateral/posterior) - mild narrowing of ostia likely from external compression by mass, but patent**
- No discrete endobronchial tumor visible (mass appears primarily parenchymal)

Secretion management: Minimal thin clear secretions throughout, suctioned clear

**Electromagnetic Navigation Setup:**

System: SuperDimension iLogic Electromagnetic Navigation Platform

**CT Planning:**
- CT chest with IV contrast dated 04/02/2025 loaded onto navigation workstation

**Virtual Pathway Planning:**
Pathway created through the following anatomic route:
- Trachea
- Left main stem bronchus
- Left lower lobe bronchus
- Posterior basal segmental bronchus
- Subsegmental branches (2 levels)

**Registration Phase:**

Registration method: Automatic registration protocol

Process:
1. Electromagnetic field generator positioned under procedure table

- Subsegmental branch points (levels 1 and 2)

Registration quality metrics:
- Number of registration points: 9 confirmed
- System accuracy indicator: 93% (green/acceptable)
- Estimated target error: <6 mm per system calculations
- Visual inspection of overlay: Good concordance between virtual and live bronchoscopic views

Time to complete registration: 12 minutes

**Navigation Phase:**

The extended working channel (EWC) with locatable guide (LG) was assembled and prepared.

The EWC/LG system was advanced through the bronchoscope working channel under electromagnetic navigational guidance.

Real-time position tracking displayed on navigation monitor showing:

- Planned pathway
- Distance to target
- 3D anatomic orientation

Navigation progress:
- Trachea to left main stem: On trajectory
- Left main stem to LLL: On trajectory
- LLL to posterior basal segment: On trajectory, minimal deviation
- Posterior basal to subsegmental branches: Required minor repositioning (system indicated 3mm anterior adjustment needed, performed successfully)
- Final positioning: Catheter advanced to deepest safe depth in subsegmental airways

**Final Navigation Metrics:**
- Tool-to-target distance: 0.9 cm (displayed on system)
- Navigation confidence score: High (per system algorithm)
- Time to navigate to target: 8 minutes

**Radial EBUS Confirmation:**

After achieving navigational target, radial EBUS probe (20 MHz, UM-S20-20R) was introduced through the extended working channel to confirm lesion localization.

**Initial rEBUS findings:**
- Pattern: Eccentric (lesion visualized but not centered around probe)
- Lesion characteristics: Hypoechoic mass with irregular, spiculated margins
- Size: Approximately 32 mm in maximum dimension
- Internal echo: Heterogeneous

**FINDINGS SUMMARY:**

**Based on Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**

**Primary Tumor:**
- Left lower lobe mass: ADENOCARCINOMA confirmed

**Lymph Node Staging:**
- Station 5 (Aortopulmonary window - contralateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N3 disease)
- Station 7 (Subcarinal - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N2 disease)
- Station 10L (Left hilar - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N1 disease)

**Preliminary Staging:**
- Primary tumor (T): T2b (3.6 cm)
- Regional lymph nodes (N): N3 (contralateral mediastinal node involvement)
- Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastases identified on PET/CT)
- **Overall Stage: IIIB (T2bN3M0)**

This represents locally advanced disease with contralateral mediastinal lymph node involvement.
**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT & DISCUSSION:**

**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIB Adenocarcinoma of the Left Lower Lobe

**Significance:**
- This is locally advanced lung cancer with extensive nodal involvement
- N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal node) makes this unresectable by surgical standards
- Patient is NOT a surgical candidate given extent of nodal disease
- Will require systemic therapy +/- radiation

**Prognostic Factors - FAVORABLE:**
- Former smoker (quit 8 years ago) - intermediate prognosis
- Good performance status (ECOG 1)
- Age 61 - relatively young
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (better prognosis than squamous, more treatment options)

**Prognostic Factors - UNFAVORABLE:**
- Stage IIIB with N3 disease
- Large primary tumor (3.6 cm)
- Multilevel nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3)

**Treatment Implications:**
- Primary treatment: Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy (PACIFIC trial paradigm)
- Alternative: Sequential chemotherapy → radiation, or clinical trial
- Role of radiation: Definitive radiation therapy to primary + involved nodal stations
- Surgical resection: Not indicated given N3 disease
- Molecular testing results will be CRITICAL:
  - If EGFR/ALK/ROS1 positive: Consider targeted therapy incorporation
  - PD-L1 status: Guides immunotherapy selection
  - Other actionable mutations: May have clinical trial options

**Awaiting:**
- Final histopathology confirmation (2-3 business days)
- Comprehensive molecular testing (7-14 days, expedite if possible)

Attending: Russell J. Miller, MD
Anesthesia: General Anesthesia
Monitoring: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

Instrument:
• Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
• Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

Estimated Blood Loss: Minimum
Complications: None

Procedure in Detail:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform. Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.

Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.

Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.

Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.

Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

Specimen(s):
• TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture
• Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture
• BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology

Impression/Plan: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

Recommendations:
• Transfer to PACU
• Obtain chest X-ray
• Discharge home once cleared by PACU
• Await pathology and culture results and based on findings follow up for EBV insertion for COPD

"This seventy-three year old female patient Catherine Martinez (medical record JJ-8374-Q, born September 8, 1951) presented for electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy targeting a left upper lobe peripheral nodule measuring twenty-three millimeters in greatest dimension on computed tomography. The lesion demonstrated a positive bronchus sign and had a standardized uptake value of five point two on positron emission tomography imaging suggesting malignancy. She underwent moderate conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam three milligrams and fentanyl one hundred micrograms achieving a Ramsay sedation score of three. Her blood pressure was monitored at ten minute intervals throughout and remained stable in the one twenties to one thirties over seventies to eighties. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored and stayed above ninety-five percent on room air. The electromagnetic navigation system was utilized with successful registration to the preoperative CT scan.

MRN: 6927483
Date of Procedure: December 7, 2016

Preoperative Diagnosis: Lung mass with left mainstem obstruction
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy

Surgeon: Daniel Carter, MD
Assistant: Monica Taylor, MD
Indications: Left mainstem obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by anesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.

On initial bronchoscopic inspection, there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction.

At this point, the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound. Six biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left mainstem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy, and forceps, we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. An ultrathin bronchoscope was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carinas within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized, but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor overlying this area to confirm distal patency.

Subsequently, the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximately 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem, which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point, the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea, and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

Recommendations:
• Await tissue diagnosis
• ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction
• If patient develops significant hemoptysis post-procedure, would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung
• If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy, will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y-stent

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia

MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum

COMPLICATIONS:	None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.
Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.
Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. 
Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process
Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.
Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 

SPECIMEN(S): 
TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.
BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Logan Pierce is a 76 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

ATTENDING:  
Sofia Mitchell MD

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia

MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum

COMPLICATIONS:	None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.
Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.
Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. 
Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process
Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.
Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 

SPECIMEN(S): 
TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.
BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Logan Pierce is a 76 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

Transfer to PACU
Obtain chest X-ray
Discharge home once cleared by PACU
