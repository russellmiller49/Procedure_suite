"Patient: Caleb Donahue
Date of Procedure: • May 13, 2023
MRN:26845173
Preoperative Diagnosis: Hemoptysis with subcarinal mass
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: • Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking
Surgeon: Lily Ashford, MD
Assistant: Gavin Mercer, MD (Attending)
Indications: Hemoptysis, significant airway obstruction, and need for tissue biopsy
Consent: Informed consent obtained from patient and family after detailed explanation of the procedure, associated risks, benefits, and alternatives.
Anesthesia:  General anesthesia 
Description of Procedure: Following induction of general anesthesia and insertion of an LMA, topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway. A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.
The video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.
Subsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.
The tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.
Persistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.
Following verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.
Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 30 cc
Post-procedure Recommendations: 
-	Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid. 
-	Await pathology results. 
-	Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise.","31627,31628,31654",synthetic_notes_with_CPT.csv,26845173,2023-05-13,False

CLINICAL HISTORY & INDICATION
Mrs. Okafor is a 65-year-old Nigerian-American female with a complex medical history including stage IIIB adenocarcinoma of the right lung (diagnosed 04/2023), status post chemoradiation therapy (completed 10/2023). She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:

Right mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung
Malignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)
Right malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells

The patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.
MULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING
Pre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:

Address airway obstruction first (most critical)
Follow with pericardial window creation
Complete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates

INFORMED CONSENT
Extensive discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy) on 10/24/2024 at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:

Bleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)
Perforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)
Arrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)
Hypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)
Need for ICU care postoperatively (expected)
Mortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)

Benefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.
Alternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).
Patient and daughter understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.

**Assessment after EBUS:** Extensive N2/N3 disease. Primary still needs biopsy for confirmation.

**PART 2: AIRWAY INSPECTION**

EBUS scope removed. Standard bronchoscope inserted.

**Finding:** LLL orifice shows endobronchial tumor - exophytic mass nearly occluding orifice, friable appearance.

**Decision:** Obtain endobronchial biopsies directly (easier/safer than navigating to peripheral component).

**Endobronchial biopsies:** 6 specimens obtained from visible LLL tumor using standard forceps.

Moderate bleeding from biopsy site. Managed with:
- Wedging bronchoscope
- Epinephrine 1:10,000, 5mL instilled
- Held position x 2 minutes
- Bleeding resolved

**ROSE (endobronchial):** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples""

SuperDimension EMN system used. CT from 03/05/2025 loaded.

**Registration:** Auto-registration, 7 points, adequate accuracy.

**Navigation:** Attempted to navigate to LLL superior segment (peripheral component of mass). However, significant tumor in proximal airway made navigation difficult. Guide advanced as far as possible but unable to reach planned target (remained ~15mm away per system).

**Radial EBUS:** Probe advanced through guide - visualized mass with eccentric pattern but adequate for sampling.

**Peripheral sampling:**
- Forceps biopsies x 5
- Brushings x 2

- Planned pathway
- Distance to target
- 3D anatomic orientation

Navigation progress:
- Trachea to left main stem: On trajectory
- Left main stem to LLL: On trajectory
- LLL to posterior basal segment: On trajectory, minimal deviation
- Posterior basal to subsegmental branches: Required minor repositioning (system indicated 3mm anterior adjustment needed, performed successfully)
- Final positioning: Catheter advanced to deepest safe depth in subsegmental airways

**Final Navigation Metrics:**
- Tool-to-target distance: 0.9 cm (displayed on system)
- Navigation confidence score: High (per system algorithm)
- Time to navigate to target: 8 minutes

**Radial EBUS Confirmation:**

After achieving navigational target, radial EBUS probe (20 MHz, UM-S20-20R) was introduced through the extended working channel to confirm lesion localization.

**Initial rEBUS findings:**
- Pattern: Eccentric (lesion visualized but not centered around probe)
- Lesion characteristics: Hypoechoic mass with irregular, spiculated margins
- Size: Approximately 32 mm in maximum dimension
- Internal echo: Heterogeneous

**Catheter adjustment:**

**FINDINGS SUMMARY:**

**Based on Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**

**Primary Tumor:**
- Left lower lobe mass: ADENOCARCINOMA confirmed

**Lymph Node Staging:**
- Station 5 (Aortopulmonary window - contralateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N3 disease)
- Station 7 (Subcarinal - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N2 disease)
- Station 10L (Left hilar - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N1 disease)

**Preliminary Staging:**
- Primary tumor (T): T2b (3.6 cm)
- Regional lymph nodes (N): N3 (contralateral mediastinal node involvement)
- Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastases identified on PET/CT)
- **Overall Stage: IIIB (T2bN3M0)**

This represents locally advanced disease with contralateral mediastinal lymph node involvement.
**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT & DISCUSSION:**

**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIB Adenocarcinoma of the Left Lower Lobe

**Significance:**
- This is locally advanced lung cancer with extensive nodal involvement
- N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal node) makes this unresectable by surgical standards
- Patient is NOT a surgical candidate given extent of nodal disease
- Will require systemic therapy +/- radiation

**Prognostic Factors - FAVORABLE:**
- Former smoker (quit 8 years ago) - intermediate prognosis
- Good performance status (ECOG 1)
- Age 61 - relatively young
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (better prognosis than squamous, more treatment options)

**Prognostic Factors - UNFAVORABLE:**
- Stage IIIB with N3 disease
- Large primary tumor (3.6 cm)
- Multilevel nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3)

**Treatment Implications:**
- Primary treatment: Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy (PACIFIC trial paradigm)
- Alternative: Sequential chemotherapy → radiation, or clinical trial
- Role of radiation: Definitive radiation therapy to primary + involved nodal stations
- Surgical resection: Not indicated given N3 disease
- Molecular testing results will be CRITICAL:
  - If EGFR/ALK/ROS1 positive: Consider targeted therapy incorporation
  - PD-L1 status: Guides immunotherapy selection
  - Other actionable mutations: May have clinical trial options

**Awaiting:**
- Final histopathology confirmation (2-3 business days)
- Comprehensive molecular testing (7-14 days, expedite if possible)
- Formal staging completion (see below)
**PLAN & FOLLOW-UP:**

**1. Staging Completion:**

"Patient: Emily Richardson
MRN: 5183947
Date: April 8, 2022

Preoperative Diagnosis: Respiratory failure secondary to extrinsic tracheal compression
Postoperative Diagnosis: Extrinsic tracheal compression s/p airway stent placement
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy, Silicone Y-stent placement, bronchoscopic intubation

Surgeon: Laura Bennett, MD
Indications: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient's family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated, a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea, inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction (at maximum) of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction extending to approximately 2 cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor.

We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization, the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.

After measuring the airways, we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75 mm in the tracheal limb, 15 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 30 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.

At this point, inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway, the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete.

Post-procedure Diagnosis: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent

Recommendations:
• Transfer to ICU
• Obtain post-procedure CXR
• TID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent

CLINICAL HISTORY & INDICATION
Mrs. Okafor is a 65-year-old Nigerian-American female with a complex medical history including stage IIIB adenocarcinoma of the right lung (diagnosed 04/2023), status post chemoradiation therapy (completed 10/2023). She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:

Right mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung
Malignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)
Right malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells

The patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.
MULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING
Pre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:

Address airway obstruction first (most critical)
Follow with pericardial window creation
Complete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates

INFORMED CONSENT
Extensive discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy) on 10/24/2024 at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:

Bleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)
Perforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)
Arrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)
Hypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)
Need for ICU care postoperatively (expected)
Mortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)

Benefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.
Alternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).
Patient and daughter understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.

"BRONCHOSCOPY REPORT - BLVR PROCEDURE
April 22, 2024

Patient: William ""Bill"" Anderson | DOB: 02/14/1956 | MRN: 87654321
Institution: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH
Physician: Sarah Kim, MD | Fellow: Michael Chang, MD

Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with end-stage COPD who presented for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. His emphysema is predominantly in the left upper lobe with CT demonstrating 85% destruction and essentially complete fissural integrity at 98%. 

After discussing risks and benefits, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. Monitoring included continuous pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and cardiac telemetry. Moderate sedation was achieved with appropriate medications.

Using a flexible bronchoscope, I entered through the mouth and performed a systematic evaluation of the entire tracheobronchial tree. The vocal cords were normal. The trachea and carina appeared unremarkable. Both mainstem bronchi were patent. Moving to the left upper lobe, I noted the characteristic changes of severe emphysema.

I proceeded with Chartis assessment of the LUL which demonstrated absent collateral ventilation - an ideal finding for valve placement. Subsequently, I placed four Zephyr endobronchial valves: one 5.5mm valve in the lingular segments, and three 4.0mm valves in the upper division bronchi. Each valve was carefully sized and positioned to ensure complete occlusion without migration risk.

The patient tolerated the procedure remarkably well without complications. Post-procedure imaging confirmed appropriate valve positioning and early signs of target lobe volume reduction.

DATE OF PROCEDURE: 5/18/2022
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal cancer with extrinsic compression of left mainstem bronchus
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Resolved mainstem obstruction s/p areo stent 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with Aero tracheobronchial stent placement in the left mainstem
SURGEON: Racheal Chung , MD 
ASSISTANT: Jenny Smith MD (fellow)
INDICATIONS: extrinsic compression of left mainstem bronchus
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. The left vocal cord was noted to be fixed consistent with vocal cord paralysis. Muscle relaxants were then given and we then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Airway inspection was performed and there were thick purulent secretions throughout the airways which were suctioned. In the mid to distal trachea there was approximately 30-40% obstruction from posterior extrinsic compression. The right mainstem was approximately 15% obstructed at the proximal orifice and opened up to be widely patent distally.  The right-sided airways were free of endobronchial disease in the mucosa was normal.  On the left there was significant airway obstruction beginning at the orifice of the left mainstem with friable erythematous mucosa causing approximately 40% obstruction however in the mid left mainstem there is significant protrusion of extrinsic mass with likely some degree of submucosal infiltration resulting in about 90-95% airway obstruction.  The therapeutic bronchoscope could not pass the lesion.  We then attempted to pass lesion with the diagnostic Q 190 bronchoscope and were also unsuccessful. We then again attempted to pass lesion with the ultrasound P190 bronchoscope which was successfully able to bypass lesion.  Approximately 5 mm proximal to the LC2 carina the airways open to near normal luminal diameter.  There were thick postobstructive secretions at all left-sided airways which were suctioned. At this point the flexible bronchoscope was removed along with the LMA and a 10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. There is a significant week which impaired ability to ventilate and multiple attempts at packing the mouth were unsuccessful.  The 10 mm rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13 mm non-ventilating tracheoscope was introduced in the airway in a similar fashion with the hope that this would eliminate/reduce the ventilator leak however similar issues arose and we subsequently decided to remove the rigid bronchoscope and perform the procedure through a 8.5 ET tube which was placed by anesthesia.  There was some hypoxia for a few minutes mostly in the mid 80s but for a short period time in the upper 70s which was likely related to the recruitment from the time period of inadequate ventilation which eventually resolved allowing us to continue with the procedure. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed however slightly too distally and was retracted into proper position with forceps. Balloon dilatation was then performed of the stent which only partially open due to significant external compression using a 10/11/12 CRE balloon which expanded the stent with only mild deformity with a subsequent diameter of the left mainstem approximately 80% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. 
Recommendations:
-	Transfer back to ward
-	Post-procedure x-ray
-	Start 3% saline nebs 3cc combined with 2cc albuterol 3 times daily for stent maintenance. 
-	Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified 
-	Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.

FELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)
ANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on 09/22/2025 yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative

OPERATION PERFORMED:
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule

CLINICAL SCENARIO:
Patient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. 

General anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. 

Olympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:
- Normal supraglottic structures
- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia
- Carina: sharp, mobile
- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy
- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from 10/05/2025 with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment identified at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.

Registration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). 

Steerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.

Radial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.

Fluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).

Cryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:

Cycle 1: 
- Freeze time: 6 minutes
- Temperature at probe tip: -165°C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)
- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20°C)

Cycle 2:
- Freeze time: 6 minutes  
- Temperature: -167°C
- Passive thaw: 4 minutes

Cycle 3:
- Freeze time: 5 minutes
- Temperature: -163°C
- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)

Throughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.

Post-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.

Cryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:
- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)
- No hemorrhage
- No airway perforation
- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)

Complete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. 

Bronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.

FINDINGS:
1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target
2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)
3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS
4. No procedural complications

SPECIMENS: None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL

INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution

COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively

DRAINS/TUBES: None placed

POST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:
1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring
2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications
4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging
5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain

**URGENT CASE - POST-BIOPSY HEMORRHAGE MANAGEMENT**

ORIGINAL PROCEDURE: Transthoracic needle biopsy RUL nodule by interventional radiology (performed 11/07/2025, 1430hrs). Biopsy complicated by significant hemorrhage with hemothorax development requiring chest tube placement. Patient transferred to ICU overnight. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.

MODIFIED INDICATION: 
Given active bleeding from biopsy site and confirmed malignancy, multidisciplinary discussion between interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Decision made for bronchoscopic approach to: (1) achieve hemostasis and (2) treat tumor definitively with ablation given high surgical risk and desire to avoid repeat intervention.

**EMERGENT BRONCHOSCOPY WITH RFA - MODIFIED PROTOCOL**

Patient still with chest tube in place (right pigtail, 14Fr). Active output decreased but persistent blood-tinged drainage 50mL/hr. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2 after transfusion.

PROCEDURE (Performed 11/08/2025, 0800hrs):
General anesthesia, intubation. Bronchoscopy showed blood in RUL but no active endobronchial source. ENB navigation to RUL posterior segment biopsy site/tumor location. Immediate goal: hemostasis. Secondary goal: tumor ablation.

RFA probe (VIVANT, 1.5cm tip) placed at hemorrhage site within tumor. Treatment modified from standard protocol:
- Initial lower power (40W x 3min) for cauterization/hemostasis
- Then standard ablation (90°C x 8min) for tumor treatment
- Careful monitoring for increased bleeding during treatment

OUTCOME: 
Successfully achieved hemostasis - no further bleeding noted post-ablation. Tumor ablation completed per protocol. Chest tube output decreased to <10mL/hr serosanguinous fluid immediately post-procedure.

COMPLICATIONS: None additional

MODIFIED PLAN:
- ICU monitoring continues
- Chest tube remains, anticipate removal tomorrow if output <50mL/24hr
- CT chest at 48hr  
- Standard post-ablation follow-up once acute issues resolved

**UNUSUAL CASE DISCUSSION:**
This represents off-label use of bronchoscopic RFA for both hemostasis and tumor treatment following complicated transthoracic biopsy. While not standard indication, multidisciplinary team felt this was best approach to manage both bleeding and provide definitive treatment in one procedure. Case to be presented at morbidity/mortality conference for systems review of management pathway.

**TEAM:** Dr. Amanda Foster (Attending), Dr. Brian Lee (Fellow), RN Maria Santos, RT Kevin Johnson
**ANESTHESIA:** Dr. Michelle Chang - General/ETT

**INDICATION:**
LLL mass 5.1cm with endobronchial extension + extensive mediastinal/hilar adenopathy. Heavy smoker (80 py). Needs diagnosis and staging.

**PROCEDURES:**
- EBUS-TBNA
- Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy
- Radial EBUS
- Transbronchial biopsies
- Endobronchial biopsies

**CONSENT:** Obtained - all risks discussed

**VENT:** PC mode, Pinsp 20, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%, Pmean 14

**PROCEDURE:**

**PART 1: EBUS-TBNA**

EBUS scope inserted through ETT (8.0, 23cm).

**Mediastinal Survey:**

**Station 2R:** 7mm - not sampled

**Station 4R:** 24mm - hypoechoic, heterogeneous
- 22G needle x 5 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 4L:** 19mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 7:** 28mm - large, hypoechoic, necrotic areas visible
- 22G needle x 5 passes (some passes yielded necrotic material)
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma, areas of necrosis""

**Station 10L:** 22mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 11L:** 18mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 3 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Assessment after EBUS:** Extensive N2/N3 disease. Primary still needs biopsy for confirmation.

**PART 2: AIRWAY INSPECTION**

EBUS scope removed. Standard bronchoscope inserted.

**Finding:** LLL orifice shows endobronchial tumor - exophytic mass nearly occluding orifice, friable appearance.

**Decision:** Obtain endobronchial biopsies directly (easier/safer than navigating to peripheral component).

**Endobronchial biopsies:** 6 specimens obtained from visible LLL tumor using standard forceps.

Moderate bleeding from biopsy site. Managed with:
- Wedging bronchoscope
- Epinephrine 1:10,000, 5mL instilled
- Held position x 2 minutes
- Bleeding resolved

**ROSE (endobronchial):** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples""

**PART 3: EMN TO PERIPHERAL COMPONENT**

Despite endobronchial component, decided to sample peripheral component as well for potentially better tissue for molecular testing.

SuperDimension EMN system used. CT from 03/05/2025 loaded.

**Registration:** Auto-registration, 7 points, adequate accuracy.

**Navigation:** Attempted to navigate to LLL superior segment (peripheral component of mass). However, significant tumor in proximal airway made navigation difficult. Guide advanced as far as possible but unable to reach planned target (remained ~15mm away per system).

**Radial EBUS:** Probe advanced through guide - visualized mass with eccentric pattern but adequate for sampling.

**Peripheral sampling:**
- Forceps biopsies x 5
- Brushings x 2

**ROSE:** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - adequate for molecular testing""

**TOTAL TIME:** 58 minutes

**EXTUBATION:** Uneventful, stable

**EBL:** ~30mL

**SPECIMENS:**
1. Station 4R TBNA x5
2. Station 4L TBNA x4
3. Station 7 TBNA x5
4. Station 10L TBNA x4
5. Station 11L TBNA x3
6. LLL endobronchial tumor biopsies x6
7. LLL peripheral component biopsies x5 (via EMN)
8. LLL brushings x2

**ALL SPECIMENS:** Request PD-L1 testing (relevant for squamous NSCLC treatment decisions)

**COMPLICATIONS:** Moderate endobronchial bleeding - resolved with epinephrine

**FINDINGS:**
- Extensive nodal disease: N2 (stations 4R, 4L, 7) and N3 (contralateral 4L) involvement
- Primary LLL squamous cell carcinoma with endobronchial extension
- Stage: At least IIIB (T3-4N3M0)

**PLAN:**
- Complete staging: Brain MRI
- Not surgical candidate due to extent of nodal disease
- Medical oncology consult - definitive chemoradiation vs clinical trial
- PD-L1 results may influence systemic therapy choice
- F/u 1 week IP clinic

Post-op CXR: No PTX

**FINDINGS SUMMARY:**

**Based on Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**

**Primary Tumor:**
- Left lower lobe mass: ADENOCARCINOMA confirmed

**Lymph Node Staging:**
- Station 5 (Aortopulmonary window - contralateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N3 disease)
- Station 7 (Subcarinal - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N2 disease)
- Station 10L (Left hilar - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N1 disease)

**Preliminary Staging:**
- Primary tumor (T): T2b (3.6 cm)
- Regional lymph nodes (N): N3 (contralateral mediastinal node involvement)
- Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastases identified on PET/CT)
- **Overall Stage: IIIB (T2bN3M0)**

This represents locally advanced disease with contralateral mediastinal lymph node involvement.
**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT & DISCUSSION:**

**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIB Adenocarcinoma of the Left Lower Lobe

**Significance:**
- This is locally advanced lung cancer with extensive nodal involvement
- N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal node) makes this unresectable by surgical standards
- Patient is NOT a surgical candidate given extent of nodal disease
- Will require systemic therapy +/- radiation

**Prognostic Factors - FAVORABLE:**
- Former smoker (quit 8 years ago) - intermediate prognosis
- Good performance status (ECOG 1)
- Age 61 - relatively young
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (better prognosis than squamous, more treatment options)

**Prognostic Factors - UNFAVORABLE:**
- Stage IIIB with N3 disease
- Large primary tumor (3.6 cm)
- Multilevel nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3)

**Treatment Implications:**
- Primary treatment: Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy (PACIFIC trial paradigm)
- Alternative: Sequential chemotherapy → radiation, or clinical trial

"Patient: Emily Richardson
MRN: 5183947
Date: April 8, 2022

Preoperative Diagnosis: Respiratory failure secondary to extrinsic tracheal compression
Postoperative Diagnosis: Extrinsic tracheal compression s/p airway stent placement
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy, Silicone Y-stent placement, bronchoscopic intubation

Surgeon: Laura Bennett, MD
Indications: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient's family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated, a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea, inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction (at maximum) of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction extending to approximately 2 cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor.

We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization, the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.

After measuring the airways, we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75 mm in the tracheal limb, 15 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 30 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.

At this point, inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway, the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete.

Post-procedure Diagnosis: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent

Recommendations:
• Transfer to ICU
• Obtain post-procedure CXR
• TID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent

"Patient: Caleb Donahue
Date of Procedure: • May 13, 2023
MRN:26845173
Preoperative Diagnosis: Hemoptysis with subcarinal mass
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: • Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking
Surgeon: Lily Ashford, MD
Assistant: Gavin Mercer, MD (Attending)
Indications: Hemoptysis, significant airway obstruction, and need for tissue biopsy
Consent: Informed consent obtained from patient and family after detailed explanation of the procedure, associated risks, benefits, and alternatives.
Anesthesia:  General anesthesia 
Description of Procedure: Following induction of general anesthesia and insertion of an LMA, topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway. A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.
The video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.
Subsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.
The tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.
Persistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.
Following verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.
Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 30 cc
Post-procedure Recommendations: 
-	Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid. 
-	Await pathology results. 
-	Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise.","31641,31652",synthetic_notes_with_registry.jsonl,26845173,2023-05-13,False

SURGEON: Mikie Gallegos, MD 
ASSISTANT(s):  Stephen Pressly M.D., Nicholas Vance M.D,
INDICATIONS:  Airway stent removal
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
SEDATION: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record, a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. 
Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle bronchi had stent in place with minimal mucous but granulation tissue the distal edge causing 50% obstruction. The right lower lobe bronchi stent was partially obstructed with thick yellow mucous. Using saline flushes and suction we were able to remove mucous. The right middle lobe stent was then grasped with flexible forceps by the proximal string and retracted. The stent was easily removed. There was significant inflammation and malacia at site of previous stent. The bronchoscope was advanced beyond the stenotic segment and the medial and lateral segments were visualized and intact.  The Right lower lobe stent was then removed in a similar fashion to the RML stent without difficulty. In the previous bed there was extensive inflammation and granulation tissue causing >50% obstruction of the airway. The bronchoscope was pushed through the obstruction using saline flushes and the distal basilar segments were visualized and intact. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were debulked with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps. During this process the superior segment of the RLL was visualized with sub-segments intact. There remained significant obstruction and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue using repetitive 30 second freeze thaw cycles. This was performed in a similar manner in the RML. Finally, using an 8-9-10 CRE dilatational balloon we were able to gently dilate the effected bronchi to increased luminal diameter. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.
RESULTS: Successful removal of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi with significant residual granulation tissue.
COMPLICATIONS: None
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- To PACU for recovery
- D/C when criteria met
- Ok to return to Hawaii on Monday if asymptomatic over weekend. 
- Recommend repeat flexible bronchoscopy with pulmonologist at Tripler within the next week to remove debris following cryotherapy.

DOB: 09/30/1942 (82 years)
DATE: 01/14/2025
LOCATION: Outpatient Procedure Room

PROCEDURE: Bedside diagnostic and therapeutic left thoracentesis without imaging guidance.
PHYSICIAN: Hannah Patel, MD

INDICATION:
82-year-old female with chronic systolic heart failure (EF 25%), progressive dyspnea, and large left pleural effusion on chest radiograph. No ultrasound available in the clinic procedure room. Thoracentesis was requested for symptomatic relief and to confirm a transudative effusion.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient was seated upright, leaning forward over a bedside table. Left posterior hemithorax was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Percussion and auscultation identified a level of dullness consistent with a moderate free-flowing effusion.

Local anesthesia was achieved with 1% lidocaine infiltrated into skin, subcutaneous tissue, and intercostal muscles at the left posterior 8th intercostal space in the mid-scapular line. Using landmark technique, an 18G over-the-needle catheter was advanced just superior to the rib into the pleural space with immediate return of straw-colored fluid.

Approximately 60 mL of fluid was aspirated into syringes and sent for chemistry (protein, LDH), cell count/differential, Gram stain/culture, and cytology. An additional 900 mL was drained slowly by gravity with the patient monitored for cough, chest discomfort, or hypotension. The catheter was then removed and a sterile dressing applied.

COMPLICATIONS:
The patient experienced mild coughing toward the end of the drainage but no significant pleuritic pain or hypotension. No immediate pneumothorax was evident clinically. Post-procedure CXR was ordered.

DISPOSITION:
The patient remained in the clinic for a brief observation period and was then discharged home with instructions to return for worsening dyspnea. Outpatient follow-up with cardiology and pulmonary clinic is arranged.

IMPRESSION:
Landmark-guided diagnostic and therapeutic left thoracentesis for presumed heart failure-related effusion; fluid characteristics pending.",32554,synthetic_notes_with_registry.jsonl,700005,2025-01-14,False

PROCEDURES:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), left lower lobe.
2. Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy to left lower lobe lesion.
3. Linear EBUS-TBNA of station 7.

OPERATOR: Karen Lee, MD (Interventional Pulmonology)

INDICATION:
64-year-old male with a 2.0 cm left lower lobe superior segment nodule and mildly enlarged subcarinal lymph node (station 7). PET shows moderate uptake in both sites. Combined nodal and parenchymal sampling requested.

PROCEDURE SUMMARY:
Under general anesthesia via ETT, a flexible bronchoscope was passed to the segmental bronchi. No endobronchial tumor was seen.

EBUS-TBNA (station 7):
A convex EBUS scope was used to sample a 1.4 cm subcarinal node. Three passes were performed with a 22G needle. ROSE was adequate with benign-appearing lymphocytes.

EM NAVIGATION + TBLB (LLL superior segment):
An EM navigation system was used to register the pre-procedure CT. The lesion in the LLL superior segment was targeted; registration error ~3 mm. The scope was advanced to the LLL superior segment, and navigation confirmed proximity to the lesion. Fluoroscopy confirmed the biopsy forceps at the lesion margin. Four transbronchial biopsies were obtained; specimens were sent for histology and molecular studies.

No significant bleeding or hypoxia occurred. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.
