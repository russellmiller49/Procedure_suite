"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Higgins, a 66-year-old gentleman with severe heterogeneous emphysema characterized by marked left upper lobe hyperinflation, presented for elective bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. Preoperative evaluation revealed an intact left oblique fissure and quantitative perfusion demonstrating preservation of the contralateral lung.
OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: Following the induction of general anesthesia and placement of an 8.0 mm endotracheal tube, the airway was examined. The left bronchial tree was systematically interrogated. A Chartis balloon catheter assessment of the LUL bronchus yielded a CV-negative phenotype (rapid flow decay to zero). Consequently, four Zephyr endobronchial valves were sequentially deployed into the apicoposterior, anterior, and lingular segments. Post-deployment inspection confirmed complete lobar occlusion. Immediate physiological response was noted via improved excursion of the left hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Successful LUL BLVR. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the step-down unit for close pneumothorax surveillance.",31647,,IP2026030_syn_2,2025-04-11,False

"Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with endobronchial valve placement, left upper lobe was performed on Edward Stone, a 68-year-old male with severe heterogeneous emphysema. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (8.0 mm ETT) was utilized. High-resolution CT showed severe LUL-predominant emphysema and intact left oblique fissure. Chartis balloon catheter deployed in the left upper lobe bronchus showed rapid flow decay to zero with plateau, consistent with absence of collateral ventilation. Under general anesthesia, a therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was advanced. Four Zephyr endobronchial valves were placed sequentially in the apicoposterior, anterior, and lingular segmental bronchi to completely occlude the LUL. Valve positions were confirmed bronchoscopically and with fluoroscopy. Minimal self-limited oozing occurred. The patient was extubated and transferred to the step-down unit for post-BLVR monitoring.",31647,,IP2026030_syn_6,2025-09-29,False

The right mainstem metallic stent was also noted to be impacted. A systematic debridement was undertaken utilizing mechanical disruption with the bronchoscope tip, extraction forceps, and mucolytic lavage with sodium bicarbonate.

Following administration of intravenous medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, a P190 hybrid video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea appeared normal. The bronchoscope was advanced to the main carina, which was noted to have a sharp angle. The scope was then directed into the left mainstem bronchus, allowing visualization of all segments and subsegments of the left upper lobe, lingula, and lower lobe; no abnormalities were identified on the left side. The bronchoscope was withdrawn to the trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. All segments and subsegments of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes were examined. Purulent material was observed emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The bronchoscope was wedged in this segment, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 60 cc of instilled saline, yielding 20 cc of return fluid. During the lavage, a cavity was visualized in the superior segment of the right lower lobe containing a well-demarcated soft tissue mass with a granular texture, consistent with a mycetoma. The right airway anatomy was notable for fusion of the apical and posterior segments in the right upper lobe; aside from the cavity, no additional masses or lesions were identified. After thorough inspection, multiple forceps biopsies were obtained from the mass within the cavity.

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway initially was not well positioned but after replacement with larger LMA seated in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. There were thick greenish mucus plugs throughout the lungs which were easily suctioned. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent right-sided malignant pleural effusion secondary to metastatic breast carcinoma

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Ultrasound-guided right-sided tunneled indwelling pleural catheter (PleurX) insertion

INDICATION: 72-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with recurrent symptomatic right malignant pleural effusion requiring weekly thoracenteses. Decision made for tunneled pleural catheter for home drainage.

INFORMED CONSENT: Procedure risks, benefits, and alternatives discussed. Patient understands and consents.

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
With the patient in left lateral decubitus position, timeout performed confirming right side. The right lateral chest wall was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound used to identify optimal insertion site in the 5th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Pocket of fluid confirmed, pleural sliding absent confirming adhesions.

Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine infiltrated along proposed tract and subcutaneous tunnel path. A 3cm incision was made at the insertion site. Using the tunneling trocar, a 10cm subcutaneous tunnel was created anteriorly ending approximately 5cm from the axilla. The PleurX catheter was drawn through the tunnel with the polyester cuff positioned 2cm from the exit site.

The pleural space was entered using Seldinger technique under real-time ultrasound guidance. The 15.5Fr PleurX catheter was advanced over the guidewire and positioned in the posterior pleural space. Good flow confirmed with drainage of 1,200mL of bloody, viscous fluid which was sent for cytology, cell count, and chemistry.

The catheter was secured with 2-0 silk suture at the exit site. Sterile dressing applied. Chest X-ray obtained showing catheter in good position with improved aeration of right lung base, no pneumothorax.

SPECIMENS: Pleural fluid to cytology, cell count, LDH, protein, glucose

COMPLICATIONS: None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal (<10mL)

DISPOSITION: Discharge home with PleurX drainage supplies and home health nursing arranged for drainage teaching and supervision.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same - Grade III tracheal stenosis, 8mm web-like

PROCEDURE:
1. Rigid bronchoscopy
2. Balloon dilation of tracheal stenosis
3. Biodegradable tracheal stent placement (BD-Stent, Merit Endotek)

INDICATION: 46-year-old male with history of prolonged intubation (28 days) for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 in 2021. Developed tracheal stenosis requiring multiple dilations. Has failed 3 prior balloon dilations with recurrence within 4-6 weeks. After discussion of options including T-tube, surgical resection, and biodegradable stent, patient elected for biodegradable stent trial given relatively young age and desire to avoid permanent stent or surgery.

ANESTHESIA: Total intravenous anesthesia (propofol/remifentanil)

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Under TIVA, rigid bronchoscopy performed using 12mm Storz ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Airway anatomy:
- Subglottic region: Normal
- Tracheal stenosis: Located 2.5cm below vocal cords, approximately 8mm thick web-like stenosis narrowing the lumen to 5mm (Grade III, Myer-Cotton)
- Distal trachea and bilateral mainstem: Normal

Balloon dilation performed using 15mm x 40mm CRE balloon (Boston Scientific). Balloon inflated to 8 ATM x 60 seconds x 3 inflations with radial fracturing of the stenosis observed. Post-dilation diameter approximately 12mm.

Merit Endotek BD-Stent (18mm diameter x 30mm length, polydioxanone-based) selected based on tracheal measurements. Stent delivery system advanced through the rigid bronchoscope and deployed under direct visualization with the proximal and distal markers positioned 1cm beyond the stenosis margins. Stent expanded fully to approximately 16mm. Confirmation of good apposition to tracheal wall.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right-sided exudative pleural effusion, unknown etiology

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dense pleural adhesions with loculated effusion; trapped lung

PLANNED PROCEDURE: Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with pleural biopsy and potential talc poudrage

ACTUAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Attempted medical thoracoscopy (aborted)
2. Conversion to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery)
3. VATS lysis of adhesions
4. VATS pleural biopsy
5. Decortication (partial)
6. Chest tube placement

INDICATION: 64-year-old female with 2-month history of progressive dyspnea. CT chest revealed large right pleural effusion with mild enhancement of pleura concerning for malignancy. Thoracentesis x 2 showed exudative effusion with negative cytology. Medical thoracoscopy planned for definitive diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube (left-sided)

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:

MEDICAL THORACOSCOPY ATTEMPT (Dr. Anderson):
Patient positioned in left lateral decubitus. After induction of general anesthesia and lung isolation, the right chest was prepped and draped. Ultrasound examination revealed a small pocket of fluid in the mid-axillary line but significant lung adherence to chest wall throughout.

A 2cm incision was made in the 6th intercostal space. Upon blunt dissection into the pleural space, immediate dense adhesions were encountered. The 7mm trocar could not be safely advanced due to extensive lung-to-chest-wall adhesions. A small pocket of loculated fluid (~200mL) was drained but no window could be created for safe pleuroscopy. Multiple attempts at different intercostal spaces (5th, 7th) encountered similar dense adhesions.

DECISION TO CONVERT: After thorough discussion with thoracic surgery colleagues and the patient's family (who had been counseled preoperatively about this possibility), the decision was made to convert to VATS for safe completion of the procedure.

VATS PROCEDURE (Dr. Kim):
The incision was extended and a 10mm port placed under direct vision where a small pleural space was identified. Two additional 5mm ports were placed. Dense adhesions were found throughout the hemithorax. Using a combination of blunt dissection, electrocautery, and harmonic scalpel, extensive adhesiolysis was performed over approximately 90 minutes.

Findings:
- Dense fibrinous adhesions throughout
- Thickened visceral pleura with trapped lung
- Nodular thickening of parietal pleura (multiple biopsies taken)
- Approximately 500mL of loculated, amber-colored fluid drained

Multiple parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from chest wall and diaphragmatic pleura. Partial decortication of the visceral pleura was performed to allow lung expansion, though complete expansion could not be achieved due to chronic entrapment.

A 28Fr chest tube was placed. Negative-pressure water seal established. Lung expansion approximately 70% at end of case.

SPECIMENS:
- Pleural fluid: Cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures, adenosine deaminase
- Pleural biopsies (multiple): Surgical pathology

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150mL

COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively. Conversion was planned contingency.

DISPOSITION: Transferred to SICU for overnight monitoring. Chest tube to suction.

POST-OPERATIVE PLAN:
1. Monitor chest tube output
2. CXR in AM
3. Await pathology - concern for malignant mesothelioma or chronic fibrinous pleuritis
4. If lung remains trapped, may require chronic indwelling pleural catheter

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Persistent bronchopleural fistula (BPF) with prolonged air leak, post right upper lobectomy for lung cancer (POD #14)

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial valve placement for bronchopleural fistula/air leak closure

INDICATION: 66-year-old male status post right upper lobectomy for stage IIA squamous cell carcinoma 14 days ago, complicated by persistent air leak via chest tube (continuous, >500mL/breath). CT chest shows persistent right apical pneumothorax with bronchial stump intact but suspected peripheral alveolar-pleural fistula in the remaining RML/RLL. Given poor surgical candidacy for re-thoracotomy (COPD, recent surgery, poor nutritional status), endobronchial valve placement was planned for non-surgical management of the air leak.

NOTE: This is NOT a BLVR procedure for emphysema/lung volume reduction. The indication is therapeutic air leak closure in the setting of BPF.

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia (TIVA) with single-lumen ETT

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:
Patient intubated and positioned supine. Flexible bronchoscopy performed. Airway inspection revealed:
- Trachea: Normal
- Right bronchial stump: Healing well, no gross leak
- Right bronchus intermedius: Patent
- Right middle lobe: Patent, normal appearance
- Right lower lobe: Segmental bronchi appeared inflamed but patent
- Left lung: Normal

Balloon occlusion testing was performed to identify the leaking segment. Sequential balloon occlusion of right lower lobe segments revealed:
- RB6 (superior segment): Partial reduction in air leak
- RB7-10 (basal segments): Further reduction with RB9 occlusion
- Combined RB6 + RB9 occlusion: Complete cessation of air leak

Based on balloon occlusion testing, decision was made to place endobronchial valves in RB6 and RB9.

Valve placement:
1. RB6 (superior segment): Zephyr 4.0mm EBV deployed. Good fit, no air flow around valve.
2. RB9 (lateral basal segment): Zephyr 4.0-LP EBV deployed. Good fit.

Post-valve bronchoscopy confirmed valves in good position. Patient's chest tube placed to water seal at end of procedure.

Immediate post-procedure assessment showed COMPLETE CESSATION of air leak on the chest tube drainage system.

DEVICES:
- Zephyr EBV 4.0mm x 1 (RB6)
- Zephyr EBV 4.0-LP x 1 (RB9)

SPECIMENS: None

COMPLICATIONS: None

EBL: Minimal

DISPOSITION: Return to thoracic surgery floor. Chest tube to water seal. If no air leak for 48 hours, will remove chest tube.

FOLLOW-UP: Will monitor for valve expectoration. Repeat bronchoscopy in 6-8 weeks for potential valve removal if air leak remains resolved. Valves may be permanent if necessary.

Date of Birth: <DATE_TIME> (Age: 75 years)
Biological Sex: Female
Date of Procedure: <DATE_TIME>
Institution: Memorial Hospital, San Francisco, <PERSON>

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 75-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 16.3 mm part-solid pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RUL anterior (B3), with positive bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 12.4.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 4. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC180F) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 19.0 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma. Station 10L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 22.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma. Station 7 demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 16.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 3.0 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated eccentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RUL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - adenocarcinoma
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Virginia Richardson, a 79-year-old female patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Maria Santos, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.3 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 27 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.0 millimeters in short axis and 23.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.7 millimeters in short axis and 13.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.8 millimeters in short axis and 24.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.0 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 08:45, for a total procedure time of 75 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:33, for a total procedure time of 123 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Nancy Gray, a 72-year-old female patient, presented to Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis, MN for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was mediastinal staging for biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 22.6 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the apical (B1) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 9.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:45.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.9 millimeters in short axis and 17.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.0 millimeters in short axis and 24.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.1 millimeters in short axis and 15.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL apical (B1). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:56, for a total procedure time of 131 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Julie Mitchell, a 82-year-old male patient, presented to Academic Health System in Miami, FL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Rachel Goldman, MD.

The clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 14.0 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the apicoposterior (B1+2) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 17.6. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 34 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.8 millimeters in short axis and 28.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.3 millimeters in short axis and 25.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 12.9 millimeters in short axis and 30.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.8 millimeters in short axis and 34.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.7 millimeters in short axis and 20.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:09, for a total procedure time of 114 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON>, a 57-year-old female patient, presented to Presbyterian Hospital in Phoenix, AZ for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.9 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 58 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:00.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 9.9 millimeters in short axis and 21.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.8 millimeters in short axis and 21.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 31.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 8 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:40, for a total procedure time of 100 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"Mr. Williams came back for his clean-up bronchoscopy. We found a good amount of dead tissue in the left lower lobe where the tumor used to be. We used a coring tool to clear it all out, which really opened up the airway. We grabbed a few biopsies from the base to check for any leftover cancer. He handled the anesthesia fine and is recovering well.","31625,31641",synthetic_pdt_notes_generator.py,9937326_syn_8,2025-10-11,False
"OPERATIVE REPORT: Rigid bronchoscopy with silicone Y-stent placement.
INDICATION: Critical central airway obstruction due to extrinsic compression.
PROCEDURE: The airway was secured with a rigid bronchoscope. Significant tracheal and carinal compression was noted. A 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent was customized and deployed. The tracheal, left, and right limbs were positioned to stent open the carina. Post-deployment inspection confirmed restored patency.","31631,31633,31637",synthetic_notes_with_registry.jsonl,48291734_syn_2,2025-03-26,False
