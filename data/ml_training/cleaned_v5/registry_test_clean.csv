"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NOTE

Date: [DATE]
Patient: Robert Martinez
[ID]
[DATE] (53 years old)

Attending: Dr. Jennifer Liu, MD
Location: VA Medical Center, San Diego, CA

INDICATION: 53-year-old male with 30 pack-year smoking history presenting with 3-day history of moderate hemoptysis (approximately 100mL/day). CT chest showed bilateral upper lobe bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud opacities. Sputum cultures pending. Bronchoscopy for airway inspection and clearance of blood/secretions.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemoptysis, likely infectious etiology vs bronchiectasis

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions; no endobronchial lesion or active bleeding source identified

PROCEDURE: Diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic suctioning

SEDATION: Moderate sedation (Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 50mcg IV)

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient was sedated and the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-P190) was introduced via the oropharynx. The vocal cords appeared normal without lesions or edema. The trachea was patent with normal mucosa. Carina was sharp.

AIRWAY FINDINGS:
- Right mainstem: Patent. Old blood coating the mucosa.
- Right upper lobe: Multiple segments with thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood. Significant bronchiectatic changes. No endobronchial lesions. No active bleeding visualized.
- Bronchus intermedius: Patent with mild inflammation
- Right middle lobe: Mucopurulent secretions, no masses
- Right lower lobe: Bronchiectatic changes, thick secretions
- Left mainstem: Patent, old blood noted
- Left upper lobe: Similar bronchiectatic changes with mucopurulent secretions. No tumor or active bleeding.
- Lingula: Mild secretions
- Left lower lobe: Bronchiectasis, mucopurulent secretions, no source of bleeding identified

THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:
Extensive suctioning performed throughout all visualized airways. Large quantities of thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood were cleared from bilateral bronchi. No single bleeding source could be identified - the hemoptysis appears to be diffuse from inflamed bronchiectatic airways.

No biopsy was performed as no discrete lesion identified. No BAL performed as secretions already sent from suctioning.

SPECIMENS: 
- Bronchial aspirate/secretions: Bacterial culture, fungal culture, AFB culture, cytology

COMPLICATIONS: None. No active bleeding during or after procedure.

EBL: Trace

POST-PROCEDURE: Patient tolerated well. No respiratory distress. CXR unchanged from pre-procedure.

IMPRESSION & PLAN:
1. Diffuse bilateral bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions - no discrete bleeding source identified
2. Hemoptysis likely from diffuse bronchiectatic mucosal inflammation with superimposed infection
3. No endobronchial malignancy identified
4. Continue empiric antibiotics pending cultures
5. Pulmonary hygiene with chest physiotherapy
6. Follow-up in 2 weeks; consider repeat CT if hemoptysis persists
