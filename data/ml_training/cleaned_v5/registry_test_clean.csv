AGE: 69
DATE OF PROCEDURE: [DATE]

SURGEON: Dr. David Chen, MD
ASSISTANT: Dr. Katherine Wong, MD (IP Fellow)
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Dr. Paul Martinez, MD
FACILITY: Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fractured right mainstem bronchus self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS)

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same; stent granulation tissue ingrowth

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal
2. Bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial granulation tissue using APC

INDICATION: 69-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy complicated by recurrent stricture of airway fistula 18 months ago for which a covered SEMS was placed in the right mainstem bronchus. Recent CT showed stent fracture with proximal wire protruding into the trachea. Patient symptomatic with worsening cough and hemoptysis.

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
Under general anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 12mm Bryan-Dumon ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Examination of the trachea revealed the fractured proximal portion of the right mainstem SEMS protruding approximately 1.5cm into the distal trachea. The fractured wire ends were sharp and had caused mucosal injury with surrounding granulation tissue formation.

A flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid scope to examine beyond the stent. The stent lumen was narrowed by approximately 40% due to granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal end. The distal right bronchus intermedius appeared patent.

The granulation tissue was treated with APC (ERBE VIO, 30W, Effect 2) at the proximal stent margin, achieving adequate hemostasis and improving visualization.

Using a combination of rigid optical forceps and alligator forceps, the proximal edge of the stent was grasped. The stent was collapsed using the forceps in a rolling fashion and withdrawn en bloc through the rigid bronchoscope.

Inspection of the airway post-removal revealed:
- Mild residual granulation tissue at the former stent site (treated with APC)
- No perforation or significant bleeding
- Bronchus intermedius patent
- Right upper, middle, and lower lobe orifices patent

Final inspection showed no debris, no significant bleeding, patent airways bilaterally. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.

SPECIMENS: None (stent sent to pathology for documentation)

COMPLICATIONS: None

EBL: 15mL

DISPOSITION: Same day discharge anticipated. Follow-up bronchoscopy in 6 weeks to assess granulation tissue recurrence.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NOTE

Date: [DATE]
Patient: Robert Martinez
[ID]
[DATE] (53 years old)

Attending: Dr. Jennifer Liu, MD
Location: VA Medical Center, San Diego, CA

INDICATION: 53-year-old male with 30 pack-year smoking history presenting with 3-day history of moderate hemoptysis (approximately 100mL/day). CT chest showed bilateral upper lobe bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud opacities. Sputum cultures pending. Bronchoscopy for airway inspection and clearance of blood/secretions.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemoptysis, likely infectious etiology vs bronchiectasis

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions; no endobronchial lesion or active bleeding source identified

PROCEDURE: Diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic suctioning

SEDATION: Moderate sedation (Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 50mcg IV)

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient was sedated and the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-P190) was introduced via the oropharynx. The vocal cords appeared normal without lesions or edema. The trachea was patent with normal mucosa. Carina was sharp.

AIRWAY FINDINGS:
- Right mainstem: Patent. Old blood coating the mucosa.
- Right upper lobe: Multiple segments with thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood. Significant bronchiectatic changes. No endobronchial lesions. No active bleeding visualized.
- Bronchus intermedius: Patent with mild inflammation
- Right middle lobe: Mucopurulent secretions, no masses
- Right lower lobe: Bronchiectatic changes, thick secretions
- Left mainstem: Patent, old blood noted
- Left upper lobe: Similar bronchiectatic changes with mucopurulent secretions. No tumor or active bleeding.
- Lingula: Mild secretions
- Left lower lobe: Bronchiectasis, mucopurulent secretions, no source of bleeding identified

THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:
Extensive suctioning performed throughout all visualized airways. Large quantities of thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood were cleared from bilateral bronchi. No single bleeding source could be identified - the hemoptysis appears to be diffuse from inflamed bronchiectatic airways.

No biopsy was performed as no discrete lesion identified. No BAL performed as secretions already sent from suctioning.

SPECIMENS: 
- Bronchial aspirate/secretions: Bacterial culture, fungal culture, AFB culture, cytology

COMPLICATIONS: None. No active bleeding during or after procedure.

EBL: Trace

POST-PROCEDURE: Patient tolerated well. No respiratory distress. CXR unchanged from pre-procedure.

IMPRESSION & PLAN:
1. Diffuse bilateral bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions - no discrete bleeding source identified
2. Hemoptysis likely from diffuse bronchiectatic mucosal inflammation with superimposed infection
3. No endobronchial malignancy identified
4. Continue empiric antibiotics pending cultures
5. Pulmonary hygiene with chest physiotherapy
6. Follow-up in 2 weeks; consider repeat CT if hemoptysis persists

PATIENT: Linda Thompson
[ID]
[DATE] (64 years old)

SURGEONS:
IP: Dr. Mark Anderson, MD (started case)
Thoracic Surgery: Dr. Sarah Kim, MD (completed case after conversion)

LOCATION: Main OR, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right-sided exudative pleural effusion, unknown etiology

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dense pleural adhesions with loculated effusion; trapped lung

PLANNED PROCEDURE: Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with pleural biopsy and potential talc poudrage

ACTUAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Attempted medical thoracoscopy (aborted)
2. Conversion to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery)
3. VATS lysis of adhesions
4. VATS pleural biopsy
5. Decortication (partial)
6. Chest tube placement

INDICATION: 64-year-old female with 2-month history of progressive dyspnea. CT chest revealed large right pleural effusion with mild enhancement of pleura concerning for malignancy. Thoracentesis x 2 showed exudative effusion with negative cytology. Medical thoracoscopy planned for definitive diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube (left-sided)

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:

MEDICAL THORACOSCOPY ATTEMPT (Dr. Anderson):
Patient positioned in left lateral decubitus. After induction of general anesthesia and lung isolation, the right chest was prepped and draped. Ultrasound examination revealed a small pocket of fluid in the mid-axillary line but significant lung adherence to chest wall throughout.

A 2cm incision was made in the 6th intercostal space. Upon blunt dissection into the pleural space, immediate dense adhesions were encountered. The 7mm trocar could not be safely advanced due to extensive lung-to-chest-wall adhesions. A small pocket of loculated fluid (~200mL) was drained but no window could be created for safe pleuroscopy. Multiple attempts at different intercostal spaces (5th, 7th) encountered similar dense adhesions.

DECISION TO CONVERT: After thorough discussion with thoracic surgery colleagues and the patient's family (who had been counseled preoperatively about this possibility), the decision was made to convert to VATS for safe completion of the procedure.

VATS PROCEDURE (Dr. Kim):
The incision was extended and a 10mm port placed under direct vision where a small pleural space was identified. Two additional 5mm ports were placed. Dense adhesions were found throughout the hemithorax. Using a combination of blunt dissection, electrocautery, and harmonic scalpel, extensive adhesiolysis was performed over approximately 90 minutes.

Findings:
- Dense fibrinous adhesions throughout
- Thickened visceral pleura with trapped lung
- Nodular thickening of parietal pleura (multiple biopsies taken)
- Approximately 500mL of loculated, amber-colored fluid drained

Multiple parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from chest wall and diaphragmatic pleura. Partial decortication of the visceral pleura was performed to allow lung expansion, though complete expansion could not be achieved due to chronic entrapment.

A 28Fr chest tube was placed. Negative-pressure water seal established. Lung expansion approximately 70% at end of case.

SPECIMENS:
- Pleural fluid: Cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures, adenosine deaminase
- Pleural biopsies (multiple): Surgical pathology

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150mL

COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively. Conversion was planned contingency.

DISPOSITION: Transferred to SICU for overnight monitoring. Chest tube to suction.

POST-OPERATIVE PLAN:
1. Monitor chest tube output
2. CXR in AM
3. Await pathology - concern for malignant mesothelioma or chronic fibrinous pleuritis
4. If lung remains trapped, may require chronic indwelling pleural catheter
