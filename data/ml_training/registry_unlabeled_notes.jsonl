The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSEDATION: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, the endotracheal tube previously in place was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. \nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle and right lower lobe bronchi were completely obstructed by granulation tissue and debris from previous bronchoscopy yesterday approximately 2 cm distal to orifice. There were small airway tears along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe and lateral aspect of right middle lobe assay where foreign body was extracted yesterday. With saline flushes we were able to bypass the obstruction in both the middle and lower lobe. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were developed with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps however as a result of chronicity of obstruction and inflammation the areas remain mostly obstructed requiring saline flushes to push through the area of obstruction.  Decision was made to place bronchial stents in hopes of reforming native airway orientation and to allow healing of airway tears. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and a thin disposable and the bronchoscope was inserted alongside an Aero 10 x 20 mm covered self-expandable metallic stent which was advanced over the guidewire and positioned within the right lower lobe bronchi and says obstruction based on direct visualization technique..  The stent was deployed however slightly distal. Attempts to retract the stent by grasping the proximal string were unsuccessful and it became obvious that the stent was oversized.  Using rigid forceps we are unable to remove the inappropriately sized stent and using a similar technique placed a 8 x 20 mm arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis.  Subsequently CRE balloon dilatation of the stent was performed and distal airways of the right lower lobe to include the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior segments were widely patent.  The superior segment was partially jailed.  Using a similar technique we then placed a 8 x 15 mm m arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis. In the right middle lobe.  Attention was taken to ensure that kissing stents did not result in obvious tissue necrosis or external compression of either airway.  The right middle lobe stent was then dilated using a CRE balloon and distal airways were widely patent. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nRESULTS: Successful insertion of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi resulting in near complete recanalization of previously obstructed airways.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- To PACU for recovery\n- Admit to internal medicine wards overnight\n- Initiate airway clearance regimen with nebulized 3% saline (3 mL) mixed with albuterol (2 mL) 3 times a day.\n- Obtain post- procedural chest x-ray \n- Plan to return to operating room in 2 weeks for stent removal \n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nTulsa Medical Center"}

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following induction and paralyitic administration by anesthesia an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. In the orifice of the right mainstem, protruding slightly into the supra-carinal space was a large mass causing complete obstruction. The lesion appeared to have a stock/base and we therefore secured the polypoid lesion using the electrocautery snare. The lesion was snared and immediately hemorrhaged briskly completely obscuring the field of view. The rigid bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem to attempt to isolate the bleeding however the patient’s oxygen saturation continued to fall and the decision was made to remove the rigid scope and insert an ETT. This was done by anesthesia using an 8.0 ETT. The patient was placed right side down to protect the left lung and while suctioning blood via a flexible bronchoscope in the ETT. Vision remained poor and we utilized topical TXA and epi to try to slow the bleeding while using cryotherapy probe to pull blood clots from the airways. Eventually the bleeding stopped and the patient’s oxygen saturation returned to normal. Once we were able to better visualize the airways we found that the left side had relatively mild blood spillover and at the LC1 carina the transected tumor was seen which was removed piecemeal using the cryotherapy probe.  Subsequently we began to debulk further into right lung. The right upper lobe was eventually visualized. We attempted to use APC to \"burn and shave\" residual airway tumor however patient would quickly desat with drops in FIO2 required to safely use thermal therapies. We were able to debulk until what was likely the distal aspect of the BI but significant tumor still remained. Patient had extremely low reserve and since he continued to desaturate limiting our ability to continue debulk we decided to APC the base or the tumor as well as the residual tumor in the airway wall until we were confident that there was no active bleeding and abort attempts to further debulk for now and to consider returning to the OR at a later date. Once this was accomplished the ETT position was confirmed to be 3cm above the carina. The bronchoscope was removed and there procedure completed. Decision in consultation with anesthesia was for patient to remain intubated for now and transfer to the ICU.\nSpecimens: Right mainstem tumor\nFluids/Blood Products:\nIVF: 1500  EBL: 200cc  Blood Products: None\n Complications: Severe hemorrhage, severe hypoxia, Escalation in level of care.\nRecommendations: \n-\tPatient to remain intubated overnight, with endobronchial blocker at bedside.\n-\tIf no bleeding overnight plan to extubate tomorrow.\n-\tWill need to discuss options moving forward.

{"note_text": "[REDACTED] for evaluation of lung infiltrates. We noted nodular mucosal changes and performed endobronchial biopsies at multiple carinas. A bronchoalveolar lavage was conducted in the right middle lobe. We then directed our attention to the left lower lobe, using radial EBUS to guide transbronchial biopsies. Finally, we performed EBUS staging, sampling the subcarinal node (station 7) while inspecting other stations which did not require biopsy."}
{"note_text": "OPERATIVE SUMMARY: The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy for management of left mainstem stent obstruction. Upon inspection, the stent itself was patent, but significant granulation tissue was noted distally, obstructing the left lower lobe. This tissue was meticulously debrided using cryotherapy. The decision was made to explant the left mainstem stent given the benign nature of the disease and distal progression. The stent was successfully extracted via the rigid barrel. Subsequent balloon dilation of the left lower lobe bronchi and submucosal injection of corticosteroids were performed to maintain patency and suppress inflammation."}
{"note_text": "Bronchoscopic microwave ablation (MWA) of right upper lobe peripheral nodule. Patient is a 62-year-old female with solitary lung metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. General anesthesia with ETT. superDimension EMN platform used to reach 18 mm RUL posterior segment nodule. Fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT confirmed tool-in-lesion. Microwave antenna advanced through extended working channel. Ablation performed with Emprint MWA system at 60 W for 420 seconds. Postablation imaging demonstrated adequate ablation zone with 8 mm margin. Transient hemoptysis of approximately 15 mL, resolved spontaneously. Admitted overnight to telemetry."}
