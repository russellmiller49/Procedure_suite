"OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient, Mr. Adams, presented for diagnostic evaluation of a 24mm partially solid nodule within the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe.

The target was approached, and radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS) demonstrated an eccentric, continuous margin. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) with 3D reconstruction verified the tool-in-lesion status.

"OPERATIVE SUMMARY: The patient, Mr. Robert Miller, was identified and a time-out was performed. Under general anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl infusions, a bronchoscopic-assisted percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy was undertaken. The bronchoscope was introduced via the existing endotracheal tube, withdrawing to the subglottic space to visualize the anterior tracheal wall. A puncture site was selected between the first and second tracheal rings. Following local anesthetic infiltration, the introducer needle was advanced into the tracheal lumen under direct bronchoscopic visualization. The Seldinger technique was utilized to place a J-wire, followed by serial dilation using a 14 French dilator and the Ciaglia Blue Rhino single-stage dilator. A Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube was smoothly inserted. Placement was confirmed bronchoscopically and via capnography. The device was sutured in place without incident.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"31600","golden_extractions/consolidated_verified_notes_v2_8_part_005.json::idx0","golden_005.json",2.0,0.0

"We performed a two-part procedure for Ms. Chen. First, we used EBUS to check the lymph nodes in the center of her chest; stations 4R and 7 both showed cancer cells. Second, we used the navigation system to reach the main tumor in her right lower lung and took several biopsy samples. This confirms the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (Stage IIIB), so we will discuss chemotherapy and radiation.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"31627,31629,31652,31654","golden_extractions/consolidated_verified_notes_v2_8_part_041.json::idx4","golden_041.json",8.0,4.0
