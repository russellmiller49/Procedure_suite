"Catherine Gray, MRN [REDACTED], a 59-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Baptist Medical Center on [REDACTED]. The indication was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup with a 27.1mm solid lesion in the RLL superior (B6), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 6.1. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of None pack-years (never). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope with 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 4L (9.1mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 2R (14.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 2L (13.2mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.8mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RLL superior (B6) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed adjacent view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by augmented fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (5 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.

The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Larry Anderson, a 82-year-old female patient, presented to Community Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 23.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the posterior basal (B10) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 2.8. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 25 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:00.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 11.9 millimeters in short axis and 22.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 27.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 16.1 millimeters in short axis and 28.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.4 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:05, for a total procedure time of 125 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Elizabeth Morgan, a 79-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 31.5 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the medial (B5) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 7.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 57 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 23.5 millimeters in short axis and 32.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 14.3 millimeters in short axis and 14.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 11.1 millimeters in short axis and 12.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 20.1 millimeters in short axis and 33.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML medial (B5). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:15, for a total procedure time of 105 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"Ruth Cooper, MRN [REDACTED], a 62-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Presbyterian Hospital on [REDACTED]. The indication was peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy with a 21.6mm ground-glass lesion in the RUL anterior (B3), bronchus sign negative. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 41 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope with 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10L (13.0mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 4L (15.7mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 11L (19.4mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.8mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RUL anterior (B3) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed eccentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by cbct. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (8 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed granuloma.

The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.

"The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure the patient could be adequately ventilation. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid trachea was free of tumor but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway causing approximately 70% obstruction. There were a few small tumor nodules present in the distal trachea mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucous throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive puss was noted distal to the stent primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus and mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe however appeared free of disease. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus and was then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge to the stent. APC was used followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We the utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and then gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided in a similar fashion outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. Open which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compressor however was still present. At this point we took our attention to the right sided airway and utilizing APC with the burn and shave technique attempting to re-cannulate the airway with partial success however obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. Measurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb and 35 mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care.",07a1ff2a301ce063,golden_113.json,structured,0.95,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without and endoluminal obstruction. On the right there was minimal structuring of the BI . On the left the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded. Radial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation however due to the proximal obstruction dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a jagwire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point we performed APC to the left maintem followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly re-opened but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets however once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture. At this point to protect from major vascular bleeding we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax and in the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation felt that chest tube placement was warranted.

Date: [REDACTED]
Attending: Dr. Nicole Turner
Clinical Summary: Patient is a 66 year old gentleman presenting with a large right sided pleural effusion, unclear etiology. Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.
We discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.
Procedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement
How it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.
Through the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.
Multiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.
After biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.
Pathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry
Patient [REDACTED] throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.
Follow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation.

"Bronchoscopy Note
Patient: [REDACTED], 58 yo female
Date: [REDACTED]
Doc: Dr. Steven Park
MRN: [REDACTED]
So [REDACTED] today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.
Brought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).
So here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.
After cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.
The distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.
Did a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.
Recommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.
Overall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.",2562624e672a698c,golden_201.json,cpt,0.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"EMERGENCY BRONCHOSCOPY - HEMOPTYSIS
[REDACTED] - 02:35AM
Pt: [REDACTED], 57M, MRN [REDACTED]
CALLED FOR: Massive hemoptysis, ICU bed 8
Got called by ICU resident at 2am - patient with known left upper lobe cavitary lesion (likely TB vs fungal) started having massive hemoptysis, estimated 300cc bright red blood over 20 minutes. Oxygen sats dropping to high 80s. Already intubated by ICU team with 8.0 ETT.
RUSHED TO BEDSIDE
Arrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.
SCOPE FINDINGS:
ETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.
RIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal
LEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.
INITIAL MEASURES:

Iced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope
Some temporary improvement but bleeding continues
Epi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect
Tranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction

BALLOON TAMPONADE:
Blood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.
Kept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.
Second deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.
FINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:
After tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.
SPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)
PLAN:

ICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)
Keep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning
Reverse any coagulopathy (check labs)
CTA chest to id[REDACTED] bleeding vessel
IR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am

ATTENDING: Dr. Jennifer Taylor
ASSISTANT: Dr. Mark Stevens, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Amanda White
RT: Christopher Lee

ANESTHESIA: Propofol and Fentanyl infusions (patient already intubated and sedated)
MONITORING: ICU monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, arterial line, telemetry
INSTRUMENT: Olympus bronchoscope, Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous tracheostomy kit, 8.0 Shiley cuffed tracheostomy tube
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT [REDACTED]: Supine with neck extension (shoulder roll)
The bronchoscope was introduced through the existing 8.0 ETT into the trachea. The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized and counted.
With bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck for local anesthesia. A 1cm vertical skin incision was made with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.
A syringe with 1% Lidocaine was attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings into the trachea under direct visualization. Aspiration of air confirmed tracheal entry. The needle was removed and the 18-gauge introducer catheter over needle was advanced into this [REDACTED] under direct visualization.
The inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place. A J-wire was passed through the catheter, visualized with the bronchoscope entering the tracheal lumen. The site was dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.
The 14Fr dilator was removed and an 8Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. The Blue Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter and advanced until the positioning mark (corresponding to 8.0 trach size) was visualized via the bronchoscope between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings.
The Blue Rhino dilator was removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
Finally, a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. [REDACTED] was confirmed bronchoscopically with the tip approximately 3cm above the carina.
The endotracheal tube was removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. End-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed appropriate ventilation. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding. A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place with 2-0 nylon sutures.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. The staff physician, Dr. Taylor, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S): None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. [REDACTED] underwent successful percutaneous tracheostomy with bronchoscopic guidance. Procedure performed without complications. CXR post-procedure shows appropriate positioning without pneumothorax. Continue mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Tracheostomy care per protocol.

MRN: [REDACTED]
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 3-year-old female presenting with sudden onset cough and wheezing 2 days ago while eating peanuts. CXR shows hyperinflation of the right lung with mediastinal shift. CT chest confirms suspected foreign body in right mainstem bronchus. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to rigid bronchoscopy for foreign body removal were discussed with the patient's parents in detail. Parents indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration, right mainstem bronchus
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration (peanut fragment), right mainstem bronchus
PROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy with Foreign Body Removal
ATTENDING: Dr. Steven Martinez
ASSISTANT: Dr. Laura White, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Katherine Brown
RT: Andrew Garcia
Anesthesia: Dr. Michelle Chen

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring
INSTRUMENT: Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope (3.5mm), optical forceps, foreign body forceps
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT [REDACTED]: Supine with shoulder roll, neck extended
A 3.5mm Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth under direct laryngoscopy. The vocal cords were visualized and appeared normal with symmetric movement. The bronchoscope was advanced through the cords into the trachea.
Initial Survey:

Larynx: Normal
Vocal cords: Normal, symmetric movement
Trachea: Normal caliber, no lesions
Carina: Sharp, normal

The bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. A foreign body was visualized 2cm distal to the carina - a tan-brown, irregular object consistent with a peanut fragment, approximately 8mm in size. The foreign body was partially occluding the right mainstem bronchus with surrounding mucosal edema and mild erythema.
Foreign Body Retrieval:
Optical forceps were advanced through the rigid bronchoscope. The peanut fragment was grasped carefully. Initial attempt at retrieval showed the fragment was somewhat friable. The fragment was gently manipulated and brought into the rigid bronchoscope barrel to prevent fragmentation. The bronchoscope and forceps with the foreign body were withdrawn as a single unit.
The foreign body was removed intact - a peanut fragment measuring approximately 8mm x 5mm.
The bronchoscope was reintroduced for inspection:

Right mainstem: Mild mucosal edema and erythema at the site, no residual foreign material
Right upper lobe: Patent
Right middle lobe: Patent
Right lower lobe: Patent with moderate secretions
Left lung: Examined and found to be normal

Secretions were suctioned from the right lower lobe. No other foreign material was id[REDACTED]. Final inspection showed:

Complete foreign body removal
Mild mucosal trauma with no active bleeding
Patent bilateral airways

The bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.
The attending, Dr. Martinez, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S):

Foreign body: Peanut fragment (retained for documentation)

IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] underwent successful rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal. A peanut fragment was removed from the right mainstem bronchus without complication. Post-procedure CXR ordered to confirm resolution of hyperinflation. Observe overnight with monitoring. Discharge tomorrow if stable. No bronchodilators needed. Counsel parents on choking prevention.

SURGEON: Russell Miller, MD
INDICATIONS: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent was obtained from the patient’s family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction(at maximum)  of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction  extending to approximately 2cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor. We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. After measuring the airways we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75mm in the tracheal limb, 15mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete
Post procedure diagnosis:
Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent.

1.         Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation
SURGEON: Aria Winslow, MD
ASSISTANT: Owen Mallory MD
INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.
Recommendations: 
•	Transfer patient back to ward room 
•	Await final pathology results  
•	Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.

Fellow: Dr. Kevin Wu, MD

INDICATION: Severe COPD with giant bulla RUL, persistent air leak following RUL bullectomy

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial valve placement for persistent air leak management

CONSENT: Extended discussion regarding use of valves for air leak (off-label indication). Risks discussed including valve migration, persistent air leak, infection, bleeding, respiratory failure. Patient and family understood and agreed.

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:
Patient [REDACTED] IP suite with existing chest tube in place demonstrating persistent air leak (large continuous bubbling). Pre-procedure chest CT reviewed showing large residual apical cavity communicating with RUL bronchi.

Moderate sedation achieved. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed:
- Normal larynx and trachea
- RUL: Visualization of communication between RB1 and apical cavity
- Active ""sucking"" noted at RB1 entrance correlating with air leak

INTERVENTION:
Attempted placement of 5.5mm Zephyr valve in RB1. Initial deployment appeared satisfactory.

COMPLICATION:
Immediately following valve placement, patient developed acute desaturation to 82% on 4L NC. Simultaneously noted increase in subcutaneous emphysema and asymmetric chest wall movement. Immediately suspected tension pneumothorax.

MANAGEMENT:
- Procedure aborted
- 100% O2 applied
- Emergency portable CXR confirmed large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift
- Cardiothoracic surgery emergently consulted
- Second chest tube placed (28Fr) with immediate improvement
- Patient stabilized

ADDITIONAL VALVE PLACEMENT:
After stabilization and with CT surgery at bedside, decision made to place additional valve in RB3 to reduce overall flow into cavity.
- 4.0mm valve placed in RB3 without incident
- Air leak notably reduced but not eliminated

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
- Partial success: Air leak reduced from large to moderate
- Complication: Iatrogenic pneumothorax requiring second chest tube
- Both chest tubes to suction with water seal

POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:
- ICU admission  
- Serial CXRs
- Consider additional valve placement if air leak persists after 72 hours
- Family meeting held, understanding confirmed

ASSISTANT: Patricia Hogan MD
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was id[REDACTED] with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina’s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an [REDACTED] CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Await tissue diagnosis
ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.
If patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. 
If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.",0db63ee38298e805,golden_210.json,structured,0.95,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Institution: [REDACTED]
Physician: Dr. Catherine Sullivan, MD | Assistant: Anna Martinez, RNFA

Indication: Valve migration and incomplete lobar occlusion

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient [REDACTED] BLVR with RUL valve placement 8 weeks ago (performed by Dr. Sullivan) with good initial response (FEV1 improved from 32% to 41% predicted). However, repeat CT at 6 weeks showed migration of RB2 valve with incomplete occlusion. Patient noted return of dyspnea over past 2 weeks.

IMAGING REVIEW:
Comparison CT demonstrates:
- RB1 valve: Excellent position, maintained
- RB2 valve: Migrated distally approximately 1.5cm  
- RB3 valve: Excellent position, maintained
- Result: Incomplete RUL occlusion with air flow to anterior segment

PROCEDURE PLAN: Bronchoscopic valve repositioning/replacement

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Flexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation. Original anatomy reviewed. 

FINDINGS:
- RB1 and RB3 valves well-seated as expected
- RB2 valve visible but clearly malpositioned in subsegmental bronchus
- Surrounding granulation tissue present

INTERVENTION:
Using specialized removal forceps, the migrated RB2 valve was carefully grasped at the retention hooks. Gentle rotational torque applied while maintaining steady traction. Valve successfully removed intact without mucosal injury.

Bronchus re-inspected: Mild granulation tissue at original deployment site. Conservative debridement performed with cytology brush.

NEW VALVE PLACEMENT:
After measuring, new 5.5mm Zephyr valve (one size larger than original 4.0mm) deployed in RB2 with improved wall contact and resistance to migration. Valve delivery system technique modified to ensure more proximal placement.

CONFIRMATION:
Final bronchoscopy confirmed all three valves in excellent position with complete RUL occlusion. No air flow detected.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Successful removal of migrated EBV
2. Successful replacement with larger valve
3. Complete RUL occlusion restored
4. No complications

PLAN:
- Outpatient procedure, observe 4 hours then discharge
- Continue prophylactic antibiotics x 5 days  
- Repeat CT in 6 weeks
- Close follow-up given history of migration

SURGEON: Mark Parsons, DO
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and thick mucus and bloody secretions were suctioned from the stent. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The trachea mucosa was friable and inflamed but without residual obstruction. The right mainstem and distal airways were normal. The left mainstem was normal however a small fractures piece of the stent was found within the left mainstem which was removed with flexible forceps without difficulty. The left sided airways were re-inspected and normal without any other residual fractured stent pieces. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed. Post-procedure, the patient developed laryngospasm requiring intubation by anesthesia. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted into the posterior oropharynx and 6cc of topical 1% lidocaine was injected onto the vocal cords prior to extubation after which the patient was able to adequately ventilate prior to transfer to the PACU. 
Complications: Post-procedure laryngospasm requiring re-intubation. 
Recommendations:
- Transfer PACU
- Obtain post procedure CXR
- Discharge to home once criteria met.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule, segment RB9, measuring 2.7 x 2.4 cm on most recent CT imaging dated [REDACTED], with associated spiculation and pleural tethering highly concerning for malignancy. Previous transthoracic needle biopsy performed on [REDACTED] yielded diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 positive, confirming primary lung origin.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: As above

PROCEDURE(S) PERFORMED:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy with complete airway survey
2. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with real-time cone-beam CT guidance
3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmation of target lesion
4. Radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe peripheral nodule
5. Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment

CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:
This is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.

DETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:
Following standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.

Anesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.

Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from [REDACTED] loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) id[REDACTED] and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.

Navigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.

Cone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.

Extended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.

Radiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90°C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation with vital signs: HR 72-85, BP 132/78 - 145/82, SpO2 98-100% on FiO2 0.6. End-tidal CO2 maintained 35-38 mmHg.

After completion of initial 8-minute cycle, probe repositioned 5mm posterior to treat overlapping zone and ensure complete ablation coverage of entire tumor volume plus 5mm margin. Second ablation cycle performed: 6 minutes, target temperature 90°C. Impedance monitoring again demonstrated appropriate curve. Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic changes throughout entire tumor volume consistent with coagulative necrosis. Ice-cream cone appearance of ablation zone well visualized extending beyond original tumor margins.

Guide sheath and EWC slowly withdrawn under direct bronchoscopic visualization. Careful inspection of airways performed showing mild mucosal hyperemia at catheter contact points but no evidence of perforation, significant edema, or active hemorrhage. Small amount of serosanguinous secretions suctioned from right lower lobe, estimated <10 mL total.

Airways irrigated with normal saline. Bronchoscope withdrawn and patient emerged from general anesthesia without complications. Following standard reversal and spontaneous ventilation recovery, patient successfully extubated with good cough and gag reflexes. Transferred to post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition with oxygen saturation 94% on 2L NC.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal, less than 15 milliliters
INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS ADMINISTERED: 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution
SPECIMENS SENT: None
COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively

FINDINGS:
1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RLL lateral basal segment target lesion
2. Radiofrequency ablation completed per protocol with two overlapping ablation zones
3. Good real-time monitoring throughout with appropriate impedance and temperature curves
4. Post-ablation imaging demonstrates adequate treatment zone with apparent complete coverage
5. No immediate procedural complications id[REDACTED]

ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
74-year-old gentleman with biopsy-proven RLL peripheral adenocarcinoma, poor surgical candidate, status post successful bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation. Procedure technically successful with good positioning and ablation parameters. Patient tolerated procedure well without complications.

PLAN:
1. Admit to Pulmonary Intermediate Care Unit (7 East) for overnight observation
2. Continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry monitoring overnight
3. Chest radiograph in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax or other acute complications
4. CT chest with intravenous contrast in 24 hours to assess ablation zone and rule out complications
5. Pain management: scheduled acetaminophen 1000mg q8h, oxycodone 5mg q6h PRN moderate pain, hydromorphone 0.5mg IV q4h PRN severe pain
6. Aggressive pulmonary toilet: incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake, chest physiotherapy as needed
7. Empiric antibiotics NOT indicated at this time given low infection risk
8. Anticipated discharge tomorrow if overnight course uncomplicated and CT scan reassuring
9. Follow-up arrangements: Clinic visit in 1 week with CXR, CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment, PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response
10. Continue home medications including COPD regimen, cardiac medications
11. Patient and family extensively counseled on post-procedure expectations, warning signs for complications (increasing dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis), importance of follow-up

I have personally performed and supervised this entire procedure. All findings, interventions, and recommendations above represent my direct involvement and assessment.

INDICATION:
73-year-old male with known squamous cell carcinoma of the mid-trachea, presenting with stridor and 80% luminal obstruction on CT and bronchoscopy. Planned rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy with debulking and airway stent placement for palliation and airway stabilization.

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
After induction of general anesthesia, a rigid tracheobronchoscope was introduced under direct visualization. Tumor causing near circumferential narrowing of the mid-trachea over ~3 cm was id[REDACTED].

Tumor Debulking:
Mechanical debulking was performed using the bevel of the rigid scope and large forceps to core out the intraluminal mass. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) at 35 W and 1.5 L/min flow was then applied circumferentially to residual tumor and bleeding points until a widely patent lumen was obtained. Approximate residual obstruction was < 20% with smooth mucosal surface.

Stent Placement:
A 16 x 50 mm straight silicone Dumon stent was selected. Under direct bronchoscopic visualization, the stent was mounted on the rigid stent loader and deployed across the involved segment. Final position covered the entire tumor bed with adequate proximal and distal margins. The stent was well seated with no migration and good distal ventilation.

The airway was reinspected distally with a flexible bronchoscope through the rigid barrel. No additional endobronchial disease was id[REDACTED]. Secretions were suctioned.

PHYSICIAN: Rachel Green, MD (Interventional Pulmonology)
ASSISTANT: Pulmonary Fellow PGY-6

INDICATION:
69-year-old male with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and recurrent symptomatic right pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis every 7–10 days. Shared decision-making favored tunneled indwelling pleural catheter placement for symptom control and outpatient management.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
Pre-procedure ultrasound confirmed a large free-flowing right pleural effusion with no significant loculations. Patient was positioned supine with head of bed elevated.

After time-out, the right lateral chest wall was prepped and draped. Local anesthesia was obtained with 1% lidocaine at the planned entry and exit sites. Under real-time ultrasound guidance, an 18G finder needle was advanced into the pleural space at the right mid-axillary line, 6th intercostal space, with return of serosanguinous fluid.

A guidewire was advanced and serial dilation performed. A subcutaneous tunnel approximately 7 cm in length was created anteriorly, and the PleurX catheter was pulled through the tunnel exiting at the anterior chest wall. The peel-away sheath was then advanced into the pleural space over the guidewire, and the catheter was inserted and the sheath removed.

The catheter was connected to a vacuum drainage bottle; approximately 1,500 mL of serosanguinous fluid was drained slowly with monitoring for chest discomfort and blood pressure changes. The catheter tip position was confirmed by ultrasound. The exit site and entry site were secured with sutures and sterile dressings.

COMPLICATIONS:
No significant pain, hypotension, or re-expansion pulmonary edema occurred. No immediate bleeding or air leak was noted.

1. Flexible bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), left lower lobe.
2. Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy to left lower lobe lesion.
3. Linear EBUS-TBNA of station 7.

OPERATOR: Karen Lee, MD (Interventional Pulmonology)

INDICATION:
64-year-old male with a 2.0 cm left lower lobe superior segment nodule and mildly enlarged subcarinal lymph node (station 7). PET shows moderate uptake in both sites. Combined nodal and parenchymal sampling requested.

PROCEDURE SUMMARY:
Under general anesthesia via ETT, a flexible bronchoscope was passed to the segmental bronchi. No endobronchial tumor was seen.

EBUS-TBNA (station 7):
A convex EBUS scope was used to sample a 1.4 cm subcarinal node. Three passes were performed with a 22G needle. ROSE was adequate with benign-appearing lymphocytes.

EM NAVIGATION + TBLB (LLL superior segment):
An EM navigation system was used to register the pre-procedure CT. The lesion in the LLL superior segment was targeted; registration error ~3 mm. The scope was advanced to the LLL superior segment, and navigation confirmed proximity to the lesion. Fluoroscopy confirmed the biopsy forceps at the lesion margin. Four transbronchial biopsies were obtained; specimens were sent for histology and molecular studies.

No significant bleeding or hypoxia occurred. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 2.0mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Inferior Lingula (LB5). Target lesion is approximately 17mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.7cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Concentric. Continuous margin noted.

Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 3 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Inferior Lingula (LB5). Instilled 80cc of NS, suction returned with 37cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

ROSE Result: Atypical cells present, suspicious for malignancy

"Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note
Procedure: Whole lung lavage (right lung)
Patient: [REDACTED], 42-year-old male with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) and progressive dyspnea.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube.
Indication: Symptomatic PAP with right-predominant crazy-paving on CT and declining oxygen requirement despite GM-CSF therapy.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After informed consent was confirmed, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the table. Standard ASA monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced and the trachea was intubated with a 37 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy and auscultation.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position with the right lung dependent. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated. The right lung was sequentially lavaged using warmed 0.9% normal saline in 1.0 L aliquots. Each aliquot was instilled via the right lumen, allowed to dwell briefly, and then drained to gravity with gentle manual chest percussion. Effluent initially appeared opaque and milky, gradually clearing over subsequent cycles.
A total of 18.0 L of saline were instilled with approximately 15.2 L recovered. The procedure was paused several times for recruitment maneuvers when oxygen saturation transiently decreased to the mid-80s, with prompt improvement after recruitment and brief return to two-lung ventilation. No hemodynamic instability occurred. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies or additional airway interventions were performed.
At the conclusion of the lavage, residual fluid was suctioned, two-lung ventilation was resumed, and the double-lumen tube was exchanged for an 8.0 single-lumen ETT. The patient was gradually weaned and extubated uneventfully in the operating room.

COMPLICATIONS: Transient desaturation to 85% during lavage cycles, resolved with recruitment and brief two-lung ventilation. No bleeding, pneumothorax, or hemodynamic compromise.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <20 mL
DISPOSITION: Transferred to ICU for overnight monitoring with expectation of step-down transfer the following day.
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Successful right lung whole lung lavage for PAP with good clearance of proteinaceous material. Continue bronchodilators and aggressive pulmonary hygiene.

Procedure: Medical thoracoscopy with talc pleurodesis (right hemithorax)
Patient: [REDACTED], 69-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and recurrent right malignant pleural effusion.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with single-lumen endotracheal tube.
Indication: Symptomatic recurrent right malignant pleural effusion with rapid reaccumulation despite prior thoracenteses.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought to the operating room, placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and intubated with an 8.0 endotracheal tube. General anesthesia was maintained with inhaled agents and intravenous opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.
Ultrasound confirmed a large right pleural effusion and a safe entry point in the 7th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic infiltration, a small skin incision was made and a trocar was advanced into the pleural space with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 1800 mL were drained.
A thoracoscope was inserted. Inspection revealed diffuse parietal pleural nodularity and a partially trapped right lower lobe. Targeted parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from diaphragmatic and posterior chest wall regions and hemostasis was achieved with cautery. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly over the parietal pleural surfaces to perform talc poudrage pleurodesis.
A 24 Fr chest tube was positioned through the same incision and secured to -20 cm H2O suction. The lung re-expanded partially with residual basilar loculations consistent with trapped lung.

COMPLICATIONS: None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL
DISPOSITION: Admitted to the medical ward with chest tube to suction.

"Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note
Procedure: Navigational bronchoscopy with radiofrequency ablation of a peripheral right lower lobe nodule.
Indication: 2.0 cm peripheral right lower lobe nodule, biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma, in a patient with limited pulmonary reserve.
Patient: 66-year-old male with GOLD III COPD.
Sedation/airway: General anesthesia with endotracheal tube.
Procedure description: After induction of general anesthesia and ETT placement, flexible bronchoscopy was performed to survey the central airways, which were free of endobronchial tumor. A navigation catheter was advanced using CT-based virtual bronchoscopy planning to a superior segment right lower lobe target. Radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric but in-branch image corresponding to the lesion. The catheter position was refined and rechecked. A radiofrequency ablation catheter was then advanced through the extended working channel to the lesion. Three overlapping ablation cycles (each 50 W for 5 minutes) were delivered with careful monitoring of impedance and tip temperature, reaching approximately 105 °C. Post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated an ablation zone encompassing the nodule. No biopsies or additional sampling were performed during this session.
Findings: Peripheral superior segment right lower lobe malignant nodule treated with radiofrequency ablation; no significant central airway pathology.
Complications: None. No pneumothorax, significant hemorrhage, or sustained hypoxia.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule J44.9 COPD

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia

MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum

COMPLICATIONS: None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.
Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.
Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. 
Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process
Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.
Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 

SPECIMEN(S): 
TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.
BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.

IMPRESSION/PLAN: This is a 74 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

 Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4R,7, 11Rs, 11Ri lymph nodes. Additionally, the 10R lymph node, although 4mm, meets sampling criteria based on PET avidity.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4R Lymph node, followed by 7, 10R,11Rs,11Ri lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was normal. On the right there was a small focus of tumor just prximal to the right upper lobe at the anterior wall which was non-obstructive. The right sided airways were otherwise normal. The left mainstem was normal.  At the takeoff of the left lower lobe there was a vascular appearing endobronchial mass causing complete airway obstruction. At the takeoff of the left upper lobe there was a similar appearing vascular endobronchial lesion causing complete airway obstruction. With gentile manipulation of the tumor it was noted to bleed easily. APC was used to devascularize the superficial layer of the left upper and lower lobe tumors.  The electrocautery snare was then used to remove the prximal portion of the left upper lobe tumor after which we cold visualize distal airways. The tumor extended to just proximal to the lingual take-off and distally there did not appear to be evidence of active tumor.  Using APC we used the burn and shave method to slowly debulk the tumor as well as flexible forceps debulking of charred tumor after APC cauterization. Bleeding was moderate and resolved with topical instillation of 1:1000 TXA through the bronchoscope. After debulking in the left upper lobe we had complete opening of the lobar and segmental bronchi. We then brought our attention to the left lower lobe lesion. Using the electrocautery snare in a similar fashion we were able to debulk the proximal tumor. There was much more extensive distal tumor in the lower lobe with tumor involving multiple segmental bronchi. Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract some of the tissue after which we utilized APC and flexible forceps in a similar fashion as performed in the left upper lobe to slowly debulk the tumor. We were able to open the left lower lobe orifice to approximately 70% of normal but despite our best efforts we could not completely remove the tumor due to the extent of disease and distal tumor infiltration. APC was used at the end of the procedure to paint cauterize any active oozing and once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the flexible bronchoscope was inserted into the posterior oropharynx via an LMA. The vocal cords appeared normal. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Within the distal right mainstem completely obstructive tumor and mucous was seen. The mucous was suctioned and tumor obstructive tumor was visualized in the proximal BI just below the right upper lobe. There was yellow plaques through the right mainstem extending into the right upper lobe with an appearance consistent with radiation bronchitis. Within the right upper lobe there was a combination of tumor and radiation bronchitis resulting in occlusion of the apical and anterior segments and about 80% obstruction of the posterior segment. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient [REDACTED] paralytics by anesthesia after which a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point we id[REDACTED] a small orifice in the tumor within the bronchus intermedius which had a stricture like appearance. The electrocautery knife was used to make radial incisions after which large volume of pus was expressed for the distal airways. A trap was placed and the purulent material was suctioned and collected for culture. We were unable to pass the thin bronchoscope through the orifice or insert a CRE balloon due to the size.    We then began to slowly debulk the endobronchial tumor through the use of a combination of APC, and forceps. We continued to debulk the tumor and utilizing an 6-7-8 CRE balloon were able to achieve approximately 70% recanalization of the proximal and mid broncus intermedius and the proximal right lower lobe orifice. A small opening was id[REDACTED] leading to the distal BI where we could see the orifice of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe however there was extensive tumor infiltration which continued into the lobar bronchi. The right middle lobe orifice was also encased with extensive tumor and we could only achieve about 10% recanalization. Infiltrating friable areas of tumor were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Due to the extent of tumor within the distal airways we did not believe that airway stent placement would be appropriate as distal tumor ingrowth would likely occur. We then addressed the right upper lobe where we were able to gently debulk tumor with APC and flexible forceps to where the apical and anterior segments (which were anatomically fused could be id[REDACTED].

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following induction and paralyitic administration by anesthesia a 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, left lung and right upper lobe appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. In the orifice of the right upper lobe there was mucosal tumor infiltration causing partial (about 30% obstruction of the lobe). Just distal to the right upper lobe orifice in the bronchus intermedius there was a large polypoid tumor with base on the lateral wall causing complete airway obstruction.  At this point the flexible forceps were used to take tissue samples for pathological evaluation.  We then attempted to secure the polypoid lesion using the electrocautery snare however were unable to get the snare to wrap around the distal aspect and this was subsequently aborted. We then used the ND-YAG  began to slowly devascularize. After which the rigid optic was reinserted and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced to the level of the lesion and using an apple coring technique with the bevel of the rigid bronchoscope we were able to cut through stock of the lesion. We then reinserted the flexible bronchoscope and using suction were able to secure the free lesion and remove en-block with suction. After this the airway was essentially open however there was significant residual mucosal tumor at the base and extending to the level of the basilar branches of the right lower lobe obstructing both the middle lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe. The middle lobe and superior segment were found and opened to approximately 50% of normal diameter.  APC was used to debulk the residual tumor using a burn and shave technique as well as flexible forceps to remove coagulated debris. We were able to achieve approximately 85% recanalization of the proximal bronchus intermedius, and 60% of the distal BI. A similar technique was then used to remove the mucosal infiltrating tumor at the orifice of the right upper lobe with end result approximately 80% recanalization. Placement of a stent to prevent re-ingrowth was considered however based on the patient’s wishes (to avoid stent unless absolutely necessary) as well as the need to likely “jail” the right middle lobe and superior segment with the stent we decided to forgo this intervention and see how patient responds both clinically and to any possible systemic therapy which might prevent recurrence. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

Description of Procedure:
The patient received intravenous medications as recorded, and topical anesthesia was administered to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree. The T190 video bronchoscope was inserted orally via a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and navigated into the tracheobronchial tree, ensuring proper placement of the LMA. Observation of the vocal cords revealed no abnormalities, and the subglottic space was unremarkable. Initial examination showed the trachea and right lung to be normal, with no signs of endobronchial disease. The left mainstem from the proximal to mid-sections appeared normal. However, an endobronchial tumor was discovered in the distal left mainstem, causing approximately 85% airway obstruction. Successfully bypassing the initial obstruction, we visualized the LC2 carina extensively infiltrated by the tumor, completely obstructing the left lower lobe and obstructing 85% of the left upper lobe's takeoff. The tumor extended into the left upper lobe, fully obstructing it and compressing the lingula, which remained patent and unaffected. Following this, the Q190 bronchoscope was replaced with the UC180F convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope, introduced orally through the LMA and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree for a thorough assessment of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Stations 2R, 7, and 4L met the sampling criteria (5mm short-axis diameter), and station 4R, although smaller than 5mm, appeared round and hypoechoic, indicating suspicion. Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed with Olympus EBUS TBNA 21 and 25-gauge needles on these nodes in the order of 4R, 2R, 7, and then 4L, with five biopsies taken at each station. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) found lymphocytes in all stations with no tumor invasion. The EBUS then provided ultrasound visualization of the lung mass in the distal left mainstem, with two 21-gauge needle passes yielding cytology samples without obvious tumor presence. All samples were forwarded for routine cytology analysis. Re-inserting the T190 bronchoscope, endobronchial biopsies of the tumor were performed, indicating malignancy through touch preps.

Subsequently, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was placed into the airway, connecting to a jet ventilator. A flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid one for additional forceps biopsies on the tumor, with samples preserved in formalin. The tumor was de-vascularized using argon plasma coagulation (APC) and gradually debulked through a ""burn and shave"" method using flexible forceps, supplemented by cryotherapy for effective tumor removal. During the procedure, a Fogarty balloon was employed in the lower lobe to facilitate airway opening, revealing and suctioning significant purulent secretions post-maneuver, and bronchial lavage for culture was conducted. Switching to the P190 ultra-slim bronchoscope revealed that tumor infiltration was evident throughout the left lower lobe into the distal segments. We then brought our attention to the left upper lobe and were able to visualize the superior and inferior lingula segments and subsegmental carinas, which showed no tumor infiltration. We were able to bypass the proximal tumor in the left upper lobe proper and open the proximal aspect of the anterior and apical posterior segments, however tumor presence was noted distally within the airways. Given the extensive nature of the disease, no further debulking was warranted, as re-cannulation would not be successful. After ensuring no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and the patient's care was transferred back to the anesthesia team for ongoing management.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation under flouroscopic and EBUS guidance with transbronchial needle aspiration, Transbronchial biopsy and bronchioalveolar lavage.  
INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   Left upper lobe lung nodule            
MEDICATIONS:    GA
FINDINGS: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the laryngeal airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion right upper lobe. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion and minor adjustments were made in positioning until a concentric US view was obtained.  Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, forceps, and brush under fluoroscopic visualization. After which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter. We then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. Specimens were sent for both microbiological and cytology/histology assessment.

Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. Following inspection the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we were able to advance the 45 degree edge catheter into the anterior segment on the right upper lobe and navigated to within 1cm of the lesion. The navigational probe was then removed and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization yielded a concentric view affirming the location.  Needle biopsies were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE showed abundant lymphocytes and inflammatory cells but no obvious malignancy. Tissue biopsies were then performed using forceps under fluoroscopic visualization. After samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the diagnostic bronchoscope was re-inserted into the airway. Subsequent inspection did not show evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed from the airway. Fluoroscopic inspection was performed and no pneumothorax was visualized at the conclusion of the procedure. 
Complications: No immediate complications

Indications: Pleural effusion
Medications: Fentanyl 3, versed 75, Lidocaine 30cc 1%
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the L lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was id[REDACTED] by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 800cc of dark bloody fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. There were multiple thick adhesions and areas of lung tethering to the posterior chest wall. We were unable to id[REDACTED] the diaphragm or apex due to fused lung that would have required extensive lysis to pass. There was extensive inflammation in the adhered lung which we could peel away relatively easily in the thinner areas to expose parietal pleura which was generally normal appearing.  The 5mm port could not fit the optical forceps and we then exchanged the it for a disposable 8mm trochar. Biopsies of the parietal pleura posteriorly as well as areas of non-ventilated fused lung adherent to the pleural (non-functional appearing) were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was no significant bleeding. The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly. 

PleurX Catheter Placement:

A guide wire was inserted into the site of pleuroscopy entry and the port was removed. A separate skin site was id[REDACTED] ~5cm inferior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <1cm incision was then performed. A subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.  The Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract. A 16 fr peel away sheath was inserted over the wire via seldinger technique. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath. Both incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed. The catheter was subsequently connected to the drainage wall suction and minimal serosanguinous fluid was drained.  The patient’s wife was then brought into the room for drainage draining and a PleurX bottle was attached to the catheter and approximate 75cc of bloody fluid was obtained. The catheter tip was then capped and the PleurX was dressed and covered with a translucent dressing. 

The patient tolerated the procedural well.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed pleural catheter in place.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Bronchus Intermedius  from mucus. 
 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12 	300	12	100	10	15
 
RUL Mass: 
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 4.0 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 19G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric after initial needle puncture into the lesion.  The following features were noted: continuous margin, heterogenous echotexture.
 
Once a tunnel had been created into the lesion with TBNA as above, Transbronchial microwave ablation was performed of the nodule as below.
