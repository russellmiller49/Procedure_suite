Vocal cords were moving bilaterally.\nA total of 4 mL of 2% lidocaine was instilled onto the vocal cords.\nSubglottis: granulation tissue along the left portion and right portion that was soft but cause approximately 15% obstruction.\nThis extended approximately 1-2 cm. \nTrachea:  The proximal and mid trachea are abnormal.\nEvidence of skin graft from the 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock position;\nhair follicles and longer hair stubbles seen within the airway.\nNumerous sutures visualized with area of pedunculated tissue around suture sites.  No evidence of dehiscence or necrosis seen.\nMain Carina: Sharp\nRight Lung Proximal Airways:  There is mild webbing of tissue at RUL take-off.\nLeft Lung Proximal Airways:  Normal anatomic branching to first subsegmental level.\nNo evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.\nMucosa: Trachea as described above.  More distal airways are normal.\nSecretions: Moderate, thin, and clear.  All secretions were suctioned to clear (therapeutic aspiration).\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, left lower lobe from mucus.\nA jag wire was introduced into the iGel and advanced to the LLL.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and the jag wire left in place.\nA bona stent 14 x 60 mm stent was deployed under direct visualization into the trachea.\nFollowing deployment the stent was approximately 0.5 cm more distal than desired.\nStent revision was performed 0.5 cm proximally with forceps.

endobronchial pathology.\nMucosa: Normal.\nSecretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).\nInstilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.\nSamples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n \nNeck Ultrasound was performed to evaluate for any abnormal vessel, mass, structures at the site of percutaneous tracheostomy.\nThere were no significant vessels/mass were noted overlying the tracheostomy site on examination from the laryngeal prominence to the sternal notch.\nThe bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization.\nThe inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized.\nNext, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\nLidocaine 1% 3ml ml was injected into the anterior neck.\nA 1 cm incision was made horizontally with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.\nSuture (3-0 prolene) was placed around the incision site to create a Rummel tourniquet.\nThe introducer needle was then passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization.\nNext, a J-wire was passed through the catheter, also visualized with the bronchoscope.\nThe site was then dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.\nThe 14 Fr dilator was then removed from the guide wire and an 8 Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level.\nThe tissue dilator was placed over the guiding catheter until the positioning mark was visualized via the bronchoscope.\nThe tissue dilator was then removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization

Consent signed.\nDetails of Procedure Performed:  \n \nThe patient remained in the ICU with a previously placed single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nThe patient was positioned supine with a padded shoulder roll in place, the head of bed elevated, and the neck moderately extended.\nA surgical brief was performed and the level of inspired fraction of oxygen was reduced to 40%.\nPatient remained on VV ECMO support. After adequate anesthesia, landmarks were palpated including the thyroid notch, cricoid, and suprasternal notch.\nNeck ultrasound was performed to confirm vascular anatomy. Exposure was excellent.\nThe anterior neck was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. \n \nA surgical time out was performed.\n5mL of 1% lidocaine was injected 2-3 cm above the sternal notch.\nIt was made higher due to the known partially high-riding innominate.\nA 3cm horizontal skin incision was made with a #15 blade knife in a natural, relaxed skin tension line midway between the cricoid cartilage and the sternal notch.\nBovie cautery was used to dissect through the platysma and down to the strap muscles, with effort made to avoid the anterior jugular veins.\nThere were two vertical engorged veins along the midline raphe with a bridging vein between then.\nThe bridging vein was dissected, suture ligated, and divided. This allowed visualization of the midline raphe.\nThe strap muscles were separated vertically at the midline with Bovie cautery. The strap muscles are retracted laterally.\nUsing a combination of blunt and careful cautery midline dissection, the anterior tracheal wall was freed of soft tissue.\nThe innominate artery was identified and protected. There was good soft tissue between the innominate and the trachea which was not disturbed.\nThe trachea was palpated to find the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings.\nThere was adequate distance between the innominate artery and the planned insertion site.\nUnder bronchoscopic guidance, the endotracheal tube cuff was deflated and was pulled back below the level of the vocal cords.\nA finder needle was placed through the anterior trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilaginous rings.\nOnce confirmed by bronchoscopy, a seldinger technique was used to serially dilate the tracheotomy over a wire and to place a # 7 cuffed shiley tracheostomy.\nThe tracheostomy cuff was inflated. Cross table ventilation was performed and the tracheostomy placement was confirmed by bronchoscopy through the tracheostomy as well as CO2 return on the anesthesia monitor.\nThe tracheostomy inner cannula was then placed. Surgicel was placed in the wound bed though hemostasis was great but plan to resume anticoagulation very shortly.\nThe tracheostomy was secured with loose 2-0 prolene sutures to the skin and tracheostomy straps to maintain airway but prevent skin pressure injuries.\nThe endotracheal tube was then withdrawn completely. The tracheostomy obturator was provided to the bedside care team.\nThe patient remained in the ICU in critical condition.

Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).\nInstilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.\nSamples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n \nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA.\nThe patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the subglottic posterior trachea where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging.\nNo suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspeciton with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope.\nPOSTERIOR MEMBRANE DEFECT\nAdvanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation.\nThe defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum.\nThe scope was subsequently introduced into the esophagus to evaluate for esophageal injury.\nWith Gastroenterology present, the length of the esophagus was examined and no esophageal defect/injury was identified.\nDecision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed.\nThe black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth.\nThe vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them.\nOnce the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed.\nIntubation was easy. \n \n \nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\n \n \t \nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect\t 8 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom \t2.5 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina\t3 cm\n \nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion as described above.\nIntubation was easy. \n \nA silicone Y-stent (16mm x 13mm x 13mm) was initially modified to have tracheal portion cover the defect with short bronchial limbs for migration prevention.\nHowever, significant difficulty was encountered advancing the stent into the deployer, eventually causing a mild tear of a bronchial limb.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular tracheal stent measuring 16mmx 45mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea.\nThe rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place.\n12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 15 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).\nTotal 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.\nSILICONE STENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEDURE \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\nAt the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the

Purulent secretions were seen throughout the airways.\nOnce secretions were suctioned inspection of the right sided airways should multiple small endobronchial nodular lesions concerning for airway metastasis.\nOn the left in the mid left mainstem a 1.5cm fistula was seen at the medial aspect of the posterior wall.\nDistally (similar to what was seen on the right) were multiple small endobronchial lesions with an appearance suggestive of malignancy.\nMultiple nodules from the left and right side were biopsied with flexible forceps and placed in formalin.\nAt this point we measured the length of the fistula and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the fistula within the left mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the selected area required to cover the fistula with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 14x30 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed slightly too proximally with the distal edge just covering the fistula.\nWe then decided to place a second 14x40 Aero stent into the previously place stent to better cover the obstruction.\nThis was done in a similar fashion. On inspection after placement the originally placed stent was noted to have been pushed distally by the second stent (more distal than desired and obstructing the orifice of the left upper and lower lobe. We then removed the 14x40 stent by grasping the proximal edge with forceps. The stent could not be retracted through the tracheostomy so the trach tube was removed and then the stent was pulled through the stoma, after which re re-inserted the trach over a bronchoscope and re-attached it to the ventilator. We then retraced the remaining 14x30 mm \nAero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent into proper position (within the left mainstem covering the fistula) with forceps. Once this was done and we were satisfied with the final result the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. We then turned the patient over to anesthesia service to recover and transfer back to the ICU.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to ICU\n- Await tissue diagnosis from biopsied endobronchial nodules\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- TID saline nebulizers along with ensuring oxygen is humidified to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.", "entities":

{"id": "note_129", "text": "NOTE_ID:  note_129 SOURCE_FILE: note_129.txt Procedure Performed:\nRight-sided medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and chest tube insertion\n\nIndication:\nExudative pleural effusion\n\nMedications:\nModerate sedation per anesthesia record\n\nTopical Anesthesia:\nLidocaine 1%, 20 mL\n\nThe procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Pertinent laboratory studies and imaging were reviewed. A procedural time-out was performed.\n\nThe patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position on the procedural bed, with pressure points appropriately padded. The right-sided pleural entry site was identified using ultrasound guidance. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (ChloraPrep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry site was infiltrated with 20 mL of 1% lidocaine. A 1-cm skin incision was made, and blunt dissection was carried down to the pleural space. Finger sweep revealed pleural adhesions, which were lysed bluntly.\n\nAn 8-mm disposable primary port was placed in the right fourth intercostal space at the mid-axillary line. After air entrainment and lung deflation, an Olympus semi-rigid pleuroscope was introduced through the trocar into the pleural cavity. Suction was applied, and approximately 1,600 mL of serosanguinous pleural fluid was removed.\n\nThe pleura appeared abnormal, with areas of isolated nodularity and plaques most consistent with pachypleuritis. No significant adhesions were present. Multiple biopsies of abnormal posterior parietal pleura were obtained using forceps. Additionally, a large pleural specimen was obtained using an electrocautery knife. Approximately nine total biopsies were obtained and sent for histopathological examination. Minimal bleeding was observed.\n\nFollowing biopsies, talc pleurodesis was performed using a combination of talc poudrage and talc slurry, with a total of 5 grams of talc instilled.

Following the removal of the stent, the reconstructed right bronchus intermedius was carefully examined and was noted to have dynamic airway collapse though the degree of luminal obstruction is estimated at less than 50%.\nThe weblike fibrotic stricture arising from the posterior aspect of the right mainstem bronchus and tethering the anteromedial aspect of the main carina was divided using electrocautery knife.\nThis resulted in some freeing of the stricture, but the dynamic airway collapse continued to bring the tissues into apposition during respirations.\nThe diode laser was used to fulgurate the abutting tissue with the intent to discourage additional stricture formation.\nOnce a space had been developed, cryotherapy was used at the edges, also to discourage restenosis.\nGiven the fact that the luminal obstruction during respiration was less than 50%, and there was evidence of granulation tissue formation, we elected not to place a stent at this point in time.\nThe plan will be to bring him back for airway examination in 2 weeks to decide if silicone stent would be appropriate.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.", "entities": [[61, 73, "PROC_METHOD"], [158, 167, "MEDICATION"], [169, 190, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [659, 680, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [700, 711, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [765, 786, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [792, 823, "PROC_METHOD"], [851, 869, "PROC_METHOD"], [920, 941, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [947, 987, "PROC_METHOD"], [1015, 1033, "PROC_METHOD"], [1084, 1105, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1505, 1538, "PROC_METHOD"], [1747, 1762, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1769, 1792, "OBS_FINDING"], [1804, 1815, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1854, 1872, "OBS_LESION"], [1927, 1950, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1996, 2007, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2009, 2029, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2085, 2108, "PROC_METHOD"], [2132, 2150, "PROC_METHOD"], [2171, 2180, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2226, 2242, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2249, 2272, "OBS_FINDING"], [2372, 2382, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2414, 2419, "DEV_STENT"], [2434, 2449, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [2457, 2483, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2509, 2532, "OBS_FINDING"], [2537, 2555, "OBS_LESION"], [2561, 2566, "DEV_STENT"], [2631, 2656, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2746, 2772, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2791, 2809, "OBS_LESION"], [2831, 2837, "PROC_ACTION"], [2842, 2847, "DEV_STENT"], [2896, 2903, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2938, 2945, "PROC_ACTION"], [2953, 2958, "DEV_STENT"], [2978, 3004, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3050, 3073, "OBS_FINDING"], [3131, 3144, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST"], [3158, 3176, "OBS_LESION"], [3218, 3241, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3287, 3298, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3317, 3337, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3376, 3385, "OBS_LESION"], [3395, 3418, "OBS_FINDING"], [3491, 3502, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3515, 3524, "PROC_ACTION"], [3586, 3595, "OBS_LESION"], [3640, 3651, "PROC_ACTION"], [3773, 3786, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST"], [3814, 3832, "OBS_LESION"], [3870, 3875, "DEV_STENT"], [3981, 3989, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [3990, 3995, "DEV_STENT"], [4033, 4059, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"]]}

{"id": "note_141", "text": "Preoperative Diagnosis:\nNear-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nNear-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia\n\nProcedure Performed:\nRigid bronchoscopy with silicone Y-stent placement\n\nIndication:\nNear-complete tracheal obstruction requiring urgent intervention\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure\n\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure after discussion, in lay terms, of the indications, procedural details, risks, benefits, and alternatives. The patient acknowledged understanding and agreed to proceed.\n\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. Initial airway inspection was performed using an ultra-slim Olympus P190 flexible bronchoscope inserted through the patient\u2019s customized 5.5-mm tracheostomy tube. At the distal margin of the tracheostomy tube, approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina, there was a ridge of granulation tissue occluding approximately 80% of the tracheostomy tube lumen. Distal to this obstruction, there was severe tracheobronchial malacia with near-complete collapse of the distal trachea and right mainstem bronchus, and approximately 75% obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus. The airway mucosa was diffusely erythematous and inflamed.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope and tracheostomy tube were removed, and an attempt was made to insert a 14-mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma; this was unsuccessful due to the small size of the stoma. The tracheostomy tube was reinserted, and rigid bronchoscopy was then attempted via the oral route. However, the patient had severely distorted upper airway anatomy and significant edema, making visualization of the posterior pharynx and vocal cords impossible. Attempts were made to insert progressively smaller rigid bronchoscopes, down to a 6-mm scope, but these were unsuccessful due to a fixed stricture within the tracheostomy tract. At this point, otolaryngology was consulted intraoperatively for assistance with surgical extension of the tracheostomy stoma. Otolaryngology also attempted visualization of the vocal cords using suspension laryngoscopy but was unsuccessful. The tracheostomy stoma was surgically extended; however, due to extensive scar tissue and concern for injury to the anterior trachea, the stoma could not be enlarged sufficiently to accommodate a large rigid bronchoscope. It was, however, extended enough to allow insertion of smaller rigid bronchoscopes. A 6-mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma and advanced to the main carina. Due to the small diameter of the scope, it was not possible to introduce usable instruments or deploy a silicone stent through the rigid bronchoscope. The decision was therefore made to deploy the smallest available silicone Y-stent (14 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 mm) through the tracheostomy stoma. The bronchial limbs were compressed with rigid forceps, and the stent was advanced toward the main carina under direct visualization using a flexible bronchoscope inserted through the left bronchial limb of the stent. After measurement, the tracheal limb was trimmed to 30 mm, the left bronchial limb to 20 mm, and the right bronchial limb to 10 mm. Advancement and seating of the stent were extremely challenging due to the patient\u2019s severely narrowed airways. Multiple techniques were employed, including manipulation with rigid optical forceps, advancement using Kelly clamps by otolaryngology under direct bronchoscopic visualization, gentle balloon dilation using a CRE balloon, and eventual insertion of a slightly larger 8-mm rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma and into the stent to help seat the bronchial limbs. During this maneuver, a small airway tear was visualized along the lateral aspect of the right mainstem bronchus, approximately 0.5 cm proximal to the right upper lobe orifice. This was felt to be caused by the distal edge of the right bronchial limb of the stent. Consideration was given to placement of a metallic stent to cover the defect; however, given concerns regarding metallic stents in benign airway disease, this was deferred. The patient received 1 gram of cefazolin intraoperatively. Thoracic surgery was consulted by phone, and based on their experience, recommended conservative management provided there was no evidence of pneumothorax. A portable chest radiograph demonstrated no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\n\nThe stent was slightly repositioned to optimize seating at the main carina. There was mild tenting of the distal right bronchial limb at the site of the airway tear that could not be corrected; otherwise, the stent was well seated, with resolution of distal tracheal and mainstem bronchial obstruction and patent distal airways. The patient\u2019s tracheostomy tube was reinserted under direct visualization through the stoma and positioned within the tracheal limb of the stent, where it was secured. The procedure was then concluded, and the patient was transferred to the ICU. Postoperative Course\n\nUpon arrival in the ICU, the patient was initially stable but subsequently developed an episode of acute hypoxia with transient PaO\u2082 <50%, associated with difficulty ventilating. This resolved rapidly with manual bag ventilation. Flexible bronchoscopy performed through the tracheostomy tube demonstrated no significant stent obstruction, though foamy, blood-tinged secretions were present, consistent with acute pulmonary edema. A chest radiograph obtained during this event showed no pneumothorax. The patient received 20 mg of furosemide intravenously, and the condom catheter was exchanged for a Foley catheter, resulting in brisk diuresis and significant improvement in tidal volumes. Persistently elevated ventilator pressures were felt to be related in part to the small tracheostomy tube. Under bronchoscopic visualization, the tracheostomy tube was exchanged for a 7.0 Bivona tracheostomy tube, which was positioned midway within the stent. This resulted in improved airway compliance and ventilation.\n\nThe patient was subsequently deemed stable. After discussion with the patient\u2019s parents, care was transitioned to the ICU team. Complications:\nSmall lateral right mainstem bronchial tear\n\nRecommendations\n\nContinue positive-pressure ventilation overnight\n\nEmpiric vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam for 7 days to prevent infection related to airway injury\n\nObtain noncontrast CT chest once the patient is stable enough for transport\n\nPlan for repeat bedside flexible bronchoscopy on or around 4/1/2019, or sooner if clinical concerns arise\n\nNotify the Interventional Pulmonology team immediately for any airway issues\n\nNote that the silicone stent is radiolucent and will not be visible on chest radiograph; CT or bronchoscopy should be used for evaluation of suspected stent-related complications\n\nAdminister 3% saline nebulizers three times daily starting tonight and continuing while the stent remains in place to reduce secretion burden and prevent stent obstruction\n\nIf tracheostomy tube removal or replacement is required, this must be performed under direct bronchoscopic visualization to ensure correct positioning within the stent and to avoid kinking or obstruction\n\nInterventional Pulmonology will continue to follow", "entities": [{"span_id": "OBS_LESION_70",

A procedural time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing administration of intravenous anesthetic medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q180 slim video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via a laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was subsequently introduced through the mouth via the laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\nProcedure Description and Findings\n\nThe laryngeal mask airway was in normal position.\nThe vocal cords moved normally with respiration. The subglottic space was normal.\nThe trachea was of normal caliber, and the carina was sharp.\nThe tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level.\nBronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal, with no endobronchial lesions identified, except for extrinsic compression of the left upper lobe posterior segment.\nNo significant secretions were present.\n\nEndobronchial Ultrasound Findings\n\nThe bronchoscope was withdrawn and replaced with the EBUS bronchoscope to perform ultrasound evaluation.\nA systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was conducted, revealing visible lymph nodes.\nLymph node sizing and sampling were performed using endobronchial ultrasound with an Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22-gauge needle.\nSpecimens were sent for routine cytopathologic evaluation.\n\nThe left upper lobe mass measured 24.2 mm by EBUS and 24 mm by CT.\nPET imaging was not available. On ultrasound, the mass appeared hypoechoic, heterogeneous, irregularly shaped, with sharp margins.\nMultiple surrounding vessels were noted, limiting safe needle trajectory. A small window for safe needle access was identified, and the mass was biopsied with a single pass using a 22-gauge needle.\nROSE preliminary analysis demonstrated atypical cells. However, brisk bleeding occurred following the first needle pass, and no additional ultrasound-guided passes were performed.\nAn esophageal approach was attempted but did not allow adequate visualization of the mass.\nThe EBUS bronchoscope was withdrawn, and a therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced.\nA conventional TBNA was attempted in the region of extrinsic compression in the left upper lobe posterior segment;\nhowever, the return was bloody, and no further passes were performed.\n\nAll samples were sent to cytopathology for review.\nComplications\n\nNo immediate complications.\n\nEstimated Blood Loss\n\nLess than 5 mL.\n\nImpression\n\nNormal bronchoscopic examination except for extrinsic compression of the left upper lobe posterior segment\n\nLymph node sizing and limited sampling performed via EBUS-TBNA\n\nPost-Procedure Diagnosis\n\nTechnically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy\n\nThe patient remained stable throughout the procedure and was transferred in good condition to the post-bronchoscopy recovery area for observation until discharge criteria were met.\nPreliminary findings were discussed with the patient.

The risks and benefits of the procedure, as well as sedation options and associated risks, were discussed with the patient\u2019s parent.\nAll questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained. Patient identification and the proposed procedure were verified prior to the procedure by the physician, nurse, and technician in the procedure room.\nMental status examination revealed the patient to be alert and oriented. Airway examination demonstrated a normal oropharyngeal airway.\nRespiratory examination was clear to auscultation. Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, S3, or S4.\nThe ASA physical status classification was III (a patient with severe systemic disease).\nAfter reviewing risks and benefits, the patient was deemed an appropriate candidate to undergo the procedure under general anesthesia.\nImmediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was reassessed and found to be appropriate for sedation.\nHeart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, adequacy of ventilation, and response to care were continuously monitored throughout the procedure.\nThe patient\u2019s physical status was reassessed following completion of the procedure.\nProcedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were again explained to the patient, and informed consent was documented per institutional protocol.\nA history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n\nFollowing administration of intravenous medications per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q180 slim video bronchoscope was introduced through the rigid bronchoscope after removal of the telescope and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree bilaterally.\nThe T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope was subsequently introduced and advanced into the airways. The procedure was accomplished without difficulty.\nProcedure Description:\n\nLeft Lung Abnormalities:\nA partially obstructing airway abnormality (approximately 40% luminal obstruction) was identified at the entrance to the left lower lobe.\nTumor debulking was performed using an electrocautery snare with successful coagulation.\nUpon completion, the left lower lobe entrance was fully patent.\nFindings:\n\nRight Lung Abnormalities:\nA nearly obstructing airway abnormality (>90% luminal obstruction) was identified at the entrance to the right lower lobe.\nTumor destruction was performed using argon plasma coagulation at 25 watts and 0.3 L/min, in combination with an electrocautery probe and electrocautery snare.\nThis resulted in successful recanalization.\n\nUpon completion of intervention, both the left lower lobe and right lower lobe entrances were 100% patent.\nResidual tumor remained within the anterior and lateral basal segments of the right lower lobe;\nthis tissue appeared chronic and extended into the peripheral airways and was not amenable to further intervention.\nThe right lower lobe superior segment, medial basal segment, and posterior segment were fully patent.\nTherapeutic aspiration was performed at the conclusion of the procedure to remove retained blood and secretions, with good hemostasis achieved.\nComplications: No immediate

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe arytenoids were large with a large and floppy epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.\nThe trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp.\nOn the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just distal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe.\nThe left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.\nWe then removed the bronchoscope and inserted the P190 slim bronchoscope into the airway.\nWe attempted to visualize endobronchial disease within the anterior basilar segment of the left lower lobe but could not advance the scope distally enough.\nWe then inserted the radial ultrasound through the working channel of the bronchoscope and an eccentric view of the kno0wn nodule was obtained.\nWe then performed peripheral TBNAs of the point of interest. ROSE did not show obvious malignancy.\nAt this point we removed the slim scope and inserted the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope through the mouth, and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree.\nWe attempted to wedge the scope in the lower lobe to potentially visualize the tumor with ultrasound.\nWe saw an unusual area of soft tissue which did not obviously look like would be expected from the nodule.\nTwo biopsies were performed using the 22G EBUS-TBNA needle. ROSE however showed only blood.\nFinally, fluoroscopy was brought into the room and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left lower lobe and a large sheath catheter with radial ultrasound to the area of known nodule and a concentric view of the lesion was identified with the radial EBUS.\nBiopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush with fluoroscopic guidance through the sheath.\nAfter adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not identify malignancy on preliminary samples.\nAfter suctioning blood and secretions and once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nFollowing completion of the procedure the patient was noted to have audible upper airway sounds and ventilation was difficult.\nAnd decision was made to convert to endotracheal intubation. Initially this was attempted over the bronchoscope however edema within the structures of the middle laryngeal cavity (above the vocal cords this was unsuccessful. Anesthesia was then able to intubate with the glideslope. The bronchoscope was then inserted through the ETT to confirm positioning 2cm above the carina and to suction secretions. The patient was then transferred to the ICU. \n\nComplications: Unexpected admission\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of left lower lobe pulmonary nodule\n- Will transfer to the ICU and attempt extubation later \ntoday. \n- Await final pathology", "entities": [{"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 20, "end": 31, "text":

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of what appears to be a fused anterior segment of left upper lobe with lingula. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the T190 Therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway.  A sheath catheter was advanced through the working channel into the segment of suspicion. A radial US was advanced through the sheath and concentric view of lesion was seen. Using fluoroscopy, transbronchial needle biopsies were performed. ROSE was consistent with malignancy.

of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 10 cc.\n\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Will await

The upper trachea was normal.\nThe mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the posterior wall causing about 30% airway obstruction.\nThe distal trachea had extensive tumor predominantly involving the right lateral and posterior wall and extending into the carina.\nThe very proximal left mainstem was partially obstructed from tumor infiltration of the main carina.\nBeyond this area the left mainstem, left upper and left lower lobe appeared normal without tumor involvement.\nAt the proximal aspect of the right mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing near complete obstruction (95%).\nTumor extraction was performed using APC and flexible forceps to \u201cburn and shave\u201d the tumor within the trachea and proximal right mainstem.\nOnce we were able to open the right mainstem up to the point that we could inspect the more distal airways we found extensive circumferential tumor infiltration extending to about 5mm distal to the right upper lobe.\nDistally from that point there was no evidence of tumor infiltration. There was extensive tumor within the right upper lobe.\nWe debulked the right mainstem and proximal BI area in a similar fashion.\nWe could not make out tissue plains as the tumor had completely infiltrated the airways.\nWe were able to achieve about 85% opening of the distal tracheal and 50% opening of the right mainstem.\nAt this point due to significant residual disease and fear that further debulking could result in airway perforation given that the airway tissue planes were completely lost from tumor infiltration the decision was made to place a silicone Y-stent for both improved patency and to prevent tumor ingrowth.\nWe also decided to extend stent beyond right upper lobe and \u201cjail\u201d the lobe due to tumor extension from within the right upper lobe which extended into the proximal bronchus intermedius.\nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 80mm in the tracheal limb, 30mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope (required for Y-stent insertion) was inserted through the cords and advanced into the proximal left mainstem and the stent was deployed.\nThrough the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we attempted to seed the stent in place however there was significant difficultly getting the right sided limb past the carinal infiltrative tumor and at one point the stent was noted to tear in the right sided limb.\nWe then removed the stent and inserted another stent of the same size using the same technique.\nAgain it was extremely difficult to get the stent to seed into proper position however after manipulating the stent with rigid forceps and by manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nDue to the prolonged nature of the procedure decision was made to intubate the patient prior to transfer back to the ICU.\nWe then removed the rigid bronchoscope and inserted a 7.0 ETT into the airway over a flexible bronchoscope to allow for visualization of the distal tip and directed the tip of the ETT into the proximal limb of the stent (about 2.5 cm into the stent) inflated the pilot balloon and secured the ETT in place.\nAt this point the procedure was completed and the case was turned over to anesthesia.\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-           Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.", "entities": [[69, 80, "OBS_LESION"], [81, 100, "OBS_LESION"], [116, 123, "ANAT_AIRWAY"],

telescoping right mainstem covered metallic stent.\nThe right upper lobe was partially obstructed by the distal tip of the SEM but there was no evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia and all right sided segmental airways were patent without endobronchial disease.\nOn the left the distal mainstem, lower lobe bronchi were patient without evidence of endobronchial disease.\nAt the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe takeoff there was partially obstructive endobronchial tumor causing approximately 40% reduction in caliber which did not warrant treatment at this time.\nThrough a combination of mechanical debulking with the bronchoscope tip, forceps debulking and use of sodium bicarbonate instillation the adhesive mucous was slowly removed, with near complete recanalization of the stents.\nSubsequently a mini BAL was performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe with 40cc instillation and 30cc return.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \n\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Discharge once criteria met.", "entities":

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the L lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded.\nThe pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound.\nThe patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion.\nThe entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine.\nFollowing instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.\nAn 8 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line.\nAfter allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid.\nThe rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space.\nThere was diffuse pleural studding observed. The pleura was gernerally unremarkable with the execution of a few white and yellow plaques as well as some mild tethering of the right upper lobe to the chest wall.\nBiopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination with approximately 5 total biopsies taken.\nThere was brisk but transient bleeding after the initial biopsy ans subsequently protamine was given to completely reverse patients heparin (which was held for the procedure).\nThe pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly.\nPleurX Catheter Placement:\n\nA guide wire was inserted into the site of pleuroscopy entry and the port was removed.\nA separate skin site was identified ~5cm inferior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <1cm incision was then performed.\nA subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.\nThe Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract, followed by dilatation of the pleural access tract with the 16 fr peel away sheath via seldinger technique.\nThe Pleurx catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath.\nBoth incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed.\nThe catheter was subsequently connected to the drainage wall suction and <100cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained.\nThe catheter tip was then capped and the pleurx was dressed and covered with a transulent dressing.\nThe patient tolerated the procedural well.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed minimal residual pleural air with\npleural catheter in place tracking upwards.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: 20cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion \nRecommendation:\nWill await pathology and microbiological studies\nPatient education on pleural catheter draining and will return tomorrow for initial drainage.\nHold heparin drip until 6 hours post-procedure (19:00 tonight)", "entities": [{"span_id":

{"id": "note_198", "text": "NOTE_ID:  note_198 SOURCE_FILE: note_198.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: near-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia.\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: near-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia.\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with silicone wire stent placement\nINDICATIONS: tracheal obstruction requiring intervention\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.\nThe patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.\nInitial airway inspection was performed with the ultra-slim Olympus P190 flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the patient\u2019s customized 5.5 mm tracheostomy tube.\nAt the distal margin of the tracheostomy tube approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina was a ridge of granulation tissue occluding approximately 80% of the tracheostomy tube the lumen.\nBeyond the obstruction there was severe tracheobronchial malacia with near complete obstruction of the distal trachea and right mainstem with approximately 75% obstruction of the left mainstem.\nThe airways were erythematous and inflamed throughout. The flexible bronchoscope and the tracheostomy tube were then removed and we attempted to insert a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope through the small tracheostomy stoma which was unsuccessful.\nWe then reinserted the tracheostomy tube and attempted to insert the rigid bronchoscope through the oral route however the patient had severely distorted upper airway anatomy and edema which made it impossible to visualize the posterior pharynx and vocal cords.\nWe then attempted insertion of progressively smaller rigid bronchoscope down to the smallest diameter of 6 mm without success due to a stricture is within the stoma tract.\nAt this point we called for otolaryngology\u2019s assistance in extending the stoma to allow insertion of the rigid bronchoscope.\nOnce they arrived, they attempted to visualize the vocal cords as well using suspension laryngoscopy but were unsuccessful.\nThey then surgically extended the tracheostomy stoma.  They were unable to extend the stoma to the point where the large rigid bronchoscope could be inserted due to significant scar tissue and concern for injury to the anterior trachea however they were able to extend it to the point we could insert the smaller rigid bronchoscopes.\nAt this point the 6 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma and advanced to the main carina.\nWe however unable to insert any usable instruments or have the ability to deploy the silicone stent through this rigid bronchoscope (due to size) and the decision was made to insert the smallest Y stent available (14 x 10 x 10) through the stoma with rigid forceps compressing the bronchial limbs and advance the stent to the main carina with visualization through a flexible bronchoscope inserted behind  through the left bronchial limb of the stent.\nAfter taking measurements the tracheal limb of the stent was cut to 30mm the left lime cut to 20mm and the right limb cut to 10mm.\nWe were eventually able to successfully advance the stent however the patient\u2019s airways were extremely narrowed and we had significant difficulty seating the bronchial limbs in place properly.\nWe used a variety of techniques including use of the rigid  optical forceps, advancement with Kelly clamps by ENT while we provided direct visualization with the flexible bronchoscope, insertion of CRE balloon to gently push the stent in the place and eventually insertion of the slightly larger  size 8 rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma, into the stent and manipulate the rigid scope to push the limbs into place.\nUnfortunately during this maneuver a small airway tear (likely caused by the distal edge of the stents right bronchial  limb) of the stoma was visualized at the lateral aspect of the right main stem approximately  half a centimeter above the right upper lobe.\nWe consider placing a metallic stent to cover this however were reluctant given the concerns of metallic stents and benign airway disease.\nThe patient was given 1 g of Ancef and we consulted thoracic surgery by phone to discuss options and based on their experience they felt that if there is no evidence of pneumothorax on chest x-ray this type of airway tears often resolves without intervention.\nA portable chest x-ray was then performed which showed no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\nWe are able to slightly advance the stent to see well at the main carina.\nThere was a slight tenting of the distal limb on the right at the distal margin of the airway tear which could not be corrected however otherwise the stent was well seated resulting in resolution of the distal tracheal and mainstem bronchi obstruction and the distal airways were patent.\nWe then reinserted the patient\u2019s tracheostomy tube through the stoma with direct visualization and into the tracheal limb of the stent where it was secured.\nAt this point the procedure was completed and the patient was transferred back to the ICU.\nOnce the patient arrived in the ICU at first he was doing relatively well however he had an episode of inability to ventilate and severe hypoxia with PO2 dropping below 50% transiently while we were still at the bedside.\nThis improved rapidly with manual bag ventilation. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy tube and there did not appear to be any significant obstruction of the stent however there was some foamy bloody airway secretions which were consistent with what would be seen in acute pulmonary edema.\nA chest x-ray was performed during this event (radiology technician was already at the bedside for preplanned chest x-ray) and no pneumothorax was seen.\n20 mg of Lasix were given and the patient\u2019s condom catheter was exchanged for a Foley catheter and there was a rapid diuresis after which his tidal volumes significantly improved.\nPressures required on the ventilator to maintain adequate tidal volumes were relatively high even after this maneuver and was felt  that the patient\u2019s extremely small tracheostomy tube might be contributing to high airway pressures.\nBecause of this we decided to remove the tracheostomy tube and over bronchoscopic visualization insert a 7.0 Boniva tracheostomy tube and secured this in place midway into the stent.\nThis seemed to improve his airway compliance and ventilation.  At this point the patient was deemed stable and after discussing case with parents care was turned over to the ICU team.\nComplications:  small lateral right mainstem airway tear\nRecommendations:\n-\tPatient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight\n-\tCombination vancomycin and Zosyn for 1 week to empirically prevent infection related to airway tear.\n-\tPlease obtain CT chest without contrast once patient has gained stable enough to transport.\n-\tPlan for repeat flexible bronchoscopy at bedside likely on 4/1/2019 or earlier if any concerns arise\n-\tPlease contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient.\n-\tThe patient\u2019s stent is radiolucent and will not be seen on chest x-ray, only CT.\nIf concern for stent related complication occurs flex bronchoscopy should be the first intervention followed by CT of the chest if clinically appropriate to evaluate for complications.\n-\tPatient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient\u2019s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.\n-\tIf tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.\n-\tWe will continue to follow.", "entities": [{"span_id": "PROC_ACTION_299", "note_id": "note_198", "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "Rigid bronchoscopy",

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted.\nTopical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nOn initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease.\nThe right mainstem was normal. At the level of the RUL submucosal tumor infiltration was noted wxtending into the right upper lobe causin about 70% obstruction.\nThe upper lobe subsegments could be visualize but tumor infiltration extended beyond view.\nSubmucosal tumor infiltration was seen extending through the bronchus intermedius into the proximal right lower lobe.\nThe RML was nearly completely obstructed. The superior segment had tumor infiltration extending into the subsegmental airways.\nThe basilar segments of the RLL were uneffaced.  The LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator.\nThe rigid bronchsocpe was attached to the JET ventilator. Tumor debulking was performed with APC and flexible forceps using the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope and the beveled tip of the rigid bronchoscope.\nUsing a Fogarty balloon we attempted to remove tumor from the right upper lobe , RML and sup segment of RLL but lumens remained obstructed due to extent of disease..  At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 30mm x 10mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire with direct visualization side by side with a ultrathin disposable bronchoscope (Boston Scientific Model B) and the stent was positioned with the proximal end just distal to the RUL.\nThe stent was deployed without difficulty and after minor adjustment  the stent was observed to be well-seated in the bronchus intermedius allowing aeration of the right upper lobe.\nThe non-functional RML and superior segments were occluded to prevent distal tumor ingrowth and preserve the right lower lobe basilar segments.\nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and LMA was reinserted.\nAt this point we prepped the patient for indwelling pleural catheter insertion.\nBedside ultrasound was used to localize an optimal window for tube placement.\nThe site was identified in the right 4th intercostal space latterally.\nThe site was marked, prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.\n1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.\nA 20 gauge Yueh-centesis needle with syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space with aspiration of air / fluid to verify placement.\nThe needle was removed and the catheter left in place.\nA guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter and the catheter was then withdrawn.\nA 1 cm insision was made over the wire and a  separate skin site was identified ~5cm anterior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <0.5 cm incision was then performed.\nA subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.\nThe Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract, followed by dilatation of the pleural access tract with the 16 fr peel away sheath via seldinger technique.\nThe Pleurx catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath.\nBoth incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed.\nThe catheter was subsequently connected to the IPC bottle and 300cc of serous fluid was removed.\nThe catheter tip was then capped and the Pleurx was dressed and covered with a translucent dressing.\nThe patient tolerated the procedural well.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed \nComplications: No immediate complications", "entities": [[73, 84, "OBS_LESION"], [90, 107, "OBS_LESION"], [111, 116, "LATERALITY"], [117, 133, "OBS_LESION"], [163, 181, "OBS_LESION"], [193, 213, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [214, 217, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [222, 225, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [229, 245, "OBS_LESION"], [271, 289, "PROC_METHOD"], [295, 310, "PROC_ACTION"], [315, 319, "DEV_STENT"], [320, 342, "DEV_STENT"], [356, 361, "LATERALITY"], [368, 396, "DEV_CATHETER"], [421, 449, "OBS_LESION"], [1068, 1089, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1104, 1122, "MEDICATION"], [1168, 1191, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1230, 1251, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1272, 1293, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1335, 1342, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1348, 1352, "LATERALITY"], [1353, 1357, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1394, 1415, "OBS_LESION"], [1421, 1435, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1468, 1471, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1472, 1501, "OBS_LESION"], [1531, 1547, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1561, 1576, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1582, 1592, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1628, 1646, "OBS_LESION"], [1669, 1698, "OBS_LESION"], [1730, 1750, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1760, 1785, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1791, 1794, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1817, 1827, "OBS_LESION"], [1833, 1849, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1854, 1872, "OBS_LESION"], [1918, 1934, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1942, 1945, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1967, 1970, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1989, 1994, "MEAS_SIZE"], [1995, 2025, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2093, 2107, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2133, 2147, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2153, 2170, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2191, 2205, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2207, 2222, "PROC_ACTION"], [2242, 2245, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2250, 2266, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2277, 2310, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2338, 2356, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2366, 2381, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2405, 2410, "OBS_LESION"], [2420, 2436, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2439, 2442, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2447, 2458, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2462, 2465, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2486, 2496, "OBS_LESION"], [2596, 2603, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2616, 2637, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2643, 2664, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2684, 2688, "DEV_STENT"], [2689, 2700, "DEV_STENT_SIZE"], [2701, 2745, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [2839, 2872, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2874, 2899, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2909, 2914, "DEV_STENT"], [2971, 2974, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2980, 2985, "DEV_STENT"], [3050, 3055, "DEV_STENT"], [3094, 3114, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3140, 3156, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3177, 3180, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3185, 3202, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3235, 3249, "OBS_LESION"], [3267, 3283, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3284, 3300, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3371, 3389, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3406, 3409, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3467, 3494, "DEV_CATHETER"], [3506, 3524, "PROC_METHOD"], [3615, 3620, "LATERALITY"], [3621, 3642, "ANAT_PLEURA"], [3721, 3733, "MEDICATION"], [3837, 3845, "DEV_NEEDLE"], [3846, 3866, "DEV_NEEDLE"], [3911, 3924, "ANAT_PLEURA"], [3981, 3987, "DEV_NEEDLE"], [4008, 4016, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4034, 4044, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4067, 4080, "ANAT_PLEURA"], [4093, 4101, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4110, 4118, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4141, 4145, "MEAS_SIZE"], [4173, 4177, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4269, 4278, "MEDICATION"], [4318, 4325, "MEAS_SIZE"], [4447, 4461, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4467, 4482, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4503, 4511, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4615, 4620, "MEAS_PLEURAL_DRAIN"], [4621, 4637, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4667, 4682, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4713, 4719, "MEAS_PLEURAL_DRAIN"], [4720, 4736, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4872, 4882, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4887, 4892, "MEAS_VOL"], [4926, 4934, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4963, 4969, "DEV_CATHETER"], [5121, 5147, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"]]}

The vocal cords appeared normal.\nThe tracheostomy stoma was mature without granulation tissue. There was no evidence of TE fistula. The tracheal carina was sharp.\nAll right sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental bronchi with findings notable for purulent secretions in the superior segment and basilar segments of the right lower lobe with mild extrinsic compression of the superior segment.\nThe left-sided airways were than inspected. The proximal and mid left mainstem was normal.\nIn the distal aspect of the left mainstem there was an asymmetrical complex-appearing stricture with area of attached granulation tissue, on a stalk, moving in a ball valve motion with breathing resulting in approximately 90% obstruction.\nAt this point the only was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator.\nThere is difficulty ventilating the patient with jet ventilation and oxygen saturation dropped requiring rigid bronchoscope to be removed and LMA replaced until saturation increase.\nWe then reinserted the rigid bronchoscope and had similar problems causing us to convert to closed ventilation with packing of the mouth and nose.\nOnce we are able to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation the FiO2 was decreased until exhaled FiO2 is less than 40% at which time the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and an electrocautery snare was used to remove the area of granulation tissue without difficulty and there is only minimal bleeding.\nSubsequently the electrocautery knife was used to make 2 incisions (2 and 6 o\u2019clock) in the complex-appearing stricture (which is felt to likely be from unrecognized airway trauma at time of injury) after which a phase 8/9/10 Merritt dilatation balloon was used to gently dilate the airway to a maximum diameter of 10 mm.\nAt this point, the rigid bronchoscope was advanced to the distal left mainstem and inserted through the area of the stricture for further mechanical dilatation.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then pulled back to the trachea and on repeat inspection with the flexible bronchoscope the post dilatational orifice was approximately 8 mm with orifice compromised by associated malacia.\nThere remains significant stricturing of the medial wall however decision was made not to further dilate or inserts sent at this time given plan for him to transfer to long-term neuro rehabilitation facility in Northern California in the next few days.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed after which a fresh 6.0 cuffed fenestrated Shiley tracheostomy tube was reinserted through his stoma and attached to the ventilator.\nComplications: None\nRecommendations:\n- Return to ICU for recovery \n- Will discuss case with interventional pulmonology at Stamford prior to the patient\u2019s transfer to Palo Alto neuro rehabilitation facility, as repeat dilatation and possibly temporary stent placement will likely be required.", "entities": [{"id": "ANAT_AIRWAY_28", "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 41}, {"id":

{"id": "note_207", "text": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (head and neck) \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \nMalignant obstruction of Right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left mainstem.\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking (APC and cryodebulking) \nINDICATIONS: multilobar tumor obstruction.\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe trachea was normal with the exception of some small tumor infiltration which was non-obstructive in the left lateral gutter approximately 4cm above the main carina.\nOn the right the mainstem and right upper lobe were normal without endobronchial disease.\nThere was tumor on the posterior wall of the bronchus intermedius causing about 25% obstruction.\nThe right middle lobe was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor.\nThe right lower lobe orifice was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor as well.\nOn the left there was extensive tumor within the mainstem beginning just after the main carina causing about 80-85% obstruction with tumor extending to approximately 2 cm proximal to the LC1 carina.\nWithin the left upper lobe and left lower lobe there is no evidence of endobronchial tumor and the airways were normal.\nAfter inspection the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient was given paralytics by anesthesia after which a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the ventilator.\nInitially biopsies were taken from the distal trachea just proximal to the left mainstem and the right lower lobe and tissue was given to clinical trial team and also collected for pathological review.\nWe began debulking the tumor in the right middle lobe.\nAPC was used to de-vascularize the superficial layer and cryotherapy, forceps were used to slowly debulk the lesion.\nWE were eventually able to open up the airway to where we could see the medial and lateral segments and copious post-obstructive pus was expressed and suctioned with specimen collected for culture.\nTumor continued deep into the subsegmental bronchi and we could only achieve about 40% recanalization.\nWe then moved to right lower lobe and debulked in a similar fashion.\nWe were able to get slightly better recanalization in this lobe but could only achieve approximatly 60% recanalization.\nLike in the middle lobe tumor extended distally into the subsegments.\nThe tumor at in the bronchus intermedius was then debulked with APC using the \u201cburn and shave\u201d technique with complete recanalization.\nWe then moved to the left mainstem and again using a similar technique with APC and forceps were able to achieve about 80% recanalization.\nAPC was used at the end of the procedure to paint and cauterize any active oozing and once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.\nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer patient PACU\n-\tFollow-up PRN if return of

After suctioning the clot active bleeding was encountered\noriginating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe.\nBlood was suctioned and we were able to perform two endobronchial forceps biopsies of the right middle lobe carina as well as one\nendobronchial brushing of the submucosal tumor within the BI.\nBleeding however continued from the superior segment despite attempts to control the bleeding with wedging of the bronchoscope into the\nbleeding segment, endobronchial epinephrine (5cc 2% lidocaine with epi) and endobronchial TXA (100mg).\nThe LMA was then removed, and the patient was intubated bronchoscopically with an 8.5 ETT.\nAn Arndt endobronchial blocker was then inserted into the distal right mainstem and inflated to prevent\nblood soiling of the left sided airways.\nAfter clearing residual blood from the left sided airways the patient was transferred to the ICU with the endobronchial blocker in place.\nComplications: Hemoptysis requiring endobronchial blocker and ICU admission.\nEstimated Blood Loss: 50cc\n\nPost Procedure Recommendations:\n- Admit to ICU\n- CXR upon arrival in ICU and in AM\n- Keep endobronchial blocker inflated overnight\n- In issues with ventilation occur, confirm blocker has not migrated into the trachea (vis bronchoscopy with pediatric scope)\n- Technical aspects of repositioning were discussed with the ICU team.\n- In AM if no overnight issues would deflate the balloon and if bleeding has stopped remove blocker and extubate.\n- Await final path\nTechnically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.\n- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.\n- Please call if any questions or concerns\n- Will await final pathology results", "entities": [{"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 643, "end": 664}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 670, "end": 693}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 774, "end": 795}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 915, "end": 922}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 950, "end": 956}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 972, "end": 993}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1049, "end": 1069}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1159, "end": 1173}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1225, "end": 1241}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1303, "end": 1308}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1339, "end": 1359}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1379, "end": 1396}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1401, "end": 1417}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE", "start": 1426, "end": 1443}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1451, "end": 1468}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1482, "end": 1498}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1572, "end": 1588}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1638, "end": 1675}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1756, "end": 1777}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1868, "end": 1871}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1905, "end": 1915}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1917, "end": 1918}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1943, "end": 1957}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1983, "end": 1988}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 2036, "end": 2052}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 2173, "end": 2178}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 2284, "end": 2289}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2370, "end": 2402}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2451, "end": 2454}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2459, "end": 2462}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2547, "end": 2557}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2549, "end": 2557}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2606, "end": 2624}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2813, "end": 2829}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2928, "end": 2946}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2959, "end": 2969}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2961, "end": 2969}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 3044, "end": 3067}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 3114, "end": 3118}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 3187, "end": 3191}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 3269, "end": 3285}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 3353, "end": 3360}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 3361, "end": 3369}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 3377, "end": 3394}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 3395, "end": 3401}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 3431, "end": 3439}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 3458, "end": 3463}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 3647, "end": 3658}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 3667, "end": 3676}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 3705, "end": 3708}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 3812, "end": 3839}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 3874, "end": 3888}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 4107, "end": 4117}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 4191, "end": 4195}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 4406, "end": 4413}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 4740, "end": 4748}]}

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator.\nFollowing rigid intubation the patient developed unexpected hypoxia of unclear etiology although visible chest rise was seen.\nDecision was made to extubate and then re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope using closed assisted ventilation.\nAfter re-intubating with a similar technique the mouth was packed and the nose was plugged to avoid leak.\nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed.  Gross pooling of blood was visible throughout the trachea however the trachea itself was normal.\nThe tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.\nOn the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.\nWe\u2019re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion.\nThick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.\nWe then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood.\nWe then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.\nWe then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis.\nThe mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding.\nWe then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.\nAt this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.\nWe then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.\nThe left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.\nWe were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.\nAt this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\nAt completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.\nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.\nFurther documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.\nEtiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia.\n\nComplications:\nPost-operative encephalopathy", "entities": [{"id": "ANAT_AIRWAY_73", "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 86}, {"id": "OBS_LESION_87", "label":

The vocal fold on the left was slightly edematous but the cords appeared normal.\nThe subglottic space was normal.  The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp.\nThe tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level.\nThere was significant distortion of the right sided airways with approximately 60% obstruction from external compression (seen on CT and known to be due to \u201cpinching\u201d from the spine and pulmonary artery).\nRight sided bronchial mucosa was otherwise normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.\nNo evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.\nOn the left the proximal mainstem appeared normal.

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and thewe assured the patient could be adequately ventilation.\nTopical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.\nApproximately 3 cm below the vocal cords there was significant extrinsic compression predominantly in the lateral aspects of the airway causing about 8% obstruction of the trachea.\nThe obstruction continued for approximately 6cm before opening to normal caliber 4cm above the main carinal. The carina was sharp.\nThe tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal;\nthere are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. Measurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement.\nAt this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea and advanced past the tracheal extrinsic compression and connected to the Jet ventilator while in the distal trachea.\nThe T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.\nWe the customized a 15x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 103mm in the tracheal limb, 13mm in the right mainstem limb and 20mm in the left mainstem limb.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed.\nAfter deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection.\nThe Stent was well seated with the proximal limb approximately 3 cm distal to the vocal cords.\nThe mid-stent was compressed approximately 20% by the extrinsic force of the mediastinal mass.\nThe distal trachea, left mainstem and right mainstem were widely patent. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed.\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer PACU\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- Will arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.\n- If invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\n- Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.",

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed before the intervention.\n\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation.\nTopical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.\nThe proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM).\nThe right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction.\nA few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane.\nThe proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall.\nIn the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent.\nAfter gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout.\n10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared.\nSignificant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture.\nAfter suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall.\nThe left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease.\n\nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator.\nThe rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent.\nAPC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue.\nWe then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa.\nAfter this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall.\nWe repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway.\nWe then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent.\nAPC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris.\nSignificant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present.\nAt this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success;\nhowever, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius.\nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement.\nWe customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb.\nWe also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed.\nAfter deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\nPersistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was removed, and an LMA was inserted, and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care.\nRecommendations:\n\n\u2022\tTransfer to PACU\n\u2022\tObtain post-procedure chest x-ray.\n\u2022\tPatient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation, given residual disease.\n\u2022\tPatient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucus impaction and obstruction of stent.\n\u2022\tManagement of stent-related complications was discussed with the in-patient team, and a notice for airway management precautions was placed above the patient's bed.\n\u2022\tPlan to schedule the procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after the effects of radiation should be seen).", "entities": [{"span_id": "OBS_LESION_70", "note_id": "note_219", "label":

Once it was confirmed that there was no active bleeding, the flexible bronchoscope was removed.\nFollowing the completion of the procedure, fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to assess for pneumothorax, and a moderate right-sided pneumothorax was visualized.\nThe right lateral chest wall was marked, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.\nA 20-gauge Yueh-centesis needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space under fluoroscopic visualization, with aspiration of air to verify placement.\nThe needle was then removed, and the catheter was left in place.\nA guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter, and the catheter was then withdrawn.\nA 0.5cm incision was made through the skin, and the subcutaneous tissues were dilated.\nThe 14Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain was inserted into the pleural space. The drain was immediately connected to a Pleur-evac.\nAdequate placement was confirmed by air leak and fluoroscopy. The tube was sutured in place, and a dressing was applied.\nAt this point, the endotracheal tube was removed, and the procedure was completed.\nEstimated Blood Loss: 10cc\nComplications: Pneumothorax

The trachea and right sided airways were otherwise normal.\nThe left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of obstruction in the proximal and mid portions.\nThere was a small area of abnormal mucosal thickening in the proximal posterior wall which we attempted to biopsy with forceps but specimen was lost during forceps extraction.\nAt the distal le mainstem there was complete obstruction secondary to circumferential fibrinous scar.\nWe were able to identify a pin-hole using the thin bronchoscope but could not view distally of bypass with the scope.\nA Fogarty balloon was then passed through the hole and inflated and then retracted through the stenosis to gently dilate the airway.\nPurulent material was visualized and collected via trap. This was repeated multiple times with varying sized of Fogarty balloons.\nThe electrocautery knife was then used to make linear incisions within the scar after which serial proximal dilatations were performed with the 6,7,8 Merit phased dilatational balloon.\nContinued purulent return indicated intraluminal dilatation. We were eventually able to pass the central obstruction with the therapeutic bronchoscope but distal visualization was limited.\nWith the P190X thin bronchoscope we were able to visualize free wires from previous left upper lobe resection and stenotic distal airways with associated bronchomalacia and adherent white waxy fibrinous tissue.\nWhile one airway was clearly visualized with distal carinas seen, the anatomy was extremely distorted and the extensive fibrinous material/inflammation made it impossible to confidently confirm that the other associated orifices e were not in a false

At the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.\nThe left lower lobe was completely obstructed with tumor. Forceps biopsy was performed of the visible endobronchial tumor and samples were placed in formalin.\nNext the Corecath electrocautery suction device was used to dubulk the tumor followed by cryotherapy for removal of retained tumor.\nWe were able to achieve approximately 80% luminal re-cannulation. Mild tumor infiltration was present in the airway wall until just proximal to the takeoff of the anterior-medial segment of the left lower lobe and distal to that the airways were un-effected.\nGiven that the patient has had tumor progression despite chemotherapy we felt that airway stent placement was warranted to preserve the lower lobe and prevent regrowth of tumor (barrier effect) with the understanding that this would \u201cjail\u201d the superior segment of the lower lobe and we would essentially sacrifice one segment to preserve the rest of the lobe.\nAt this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed bronchus intermedius with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and a Ultraflex 30mm x 10mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed however slightly too proximal and subsequently was removed using forceps.\nThe jagwire was re-inserted and using a similar technique an Aero 30mm x 12mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed without difficulty and the flexible bronchoscope was then re-inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the stent was observed to be well-seated in the left lower lobe and distal mainstem with the distal tip just proximal to the basilar segments of the lower lobe.\nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.\nA few minutes later while anesthesia was bagging the patient as she emerged she became difficult to ventilate and hypoxic.\nAn LMA was inserted but she could still not ventilate and anesthesia then inserted an endotracheal tube after which ventilation was restored and hypoxia resolved.\nIt was felt this episode was caused by acute laryngospasm.\nWe then inserted a flexible bronchoscope through the ETT to inspect the airways and reposition the tube proximal to the carina (was right mainstem intubated.

The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of stent obstruction.\nAt the distal edge of the stent there was some minor granulation tissue which was nonobstructive.\nDistal to the stent there was complete obstruction of the left lower lobe orifice secondary to granulation tissue.\nUsing the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract granulation tissue to visualize the segmental stenosis in the left lower lobe.\nAll of the segments were obstructed with granulation tissue as well which we also removed with cryotherapy as well as flexible forceps.\nAt this point we decided to remove the left mainstem stent for a few reasons.\nThe first is that pathology from previous bronchoscopy at time of stent placement did not show evidence of tumor and metallic stents are not advised for benign disease.\nThe second was that her new obstruction was secondary to distal granulation tissue and it was unclear whether the stent was providing any current benefit.\nFinally, our hope was that the short-term placement of the stent allowed some remodeling of the airway to relieve the previous obstruction.\nAt this point the LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway.\nUsing flexible forceps to grasp the proximal string on the stent we were able to gently retract the stent and remove it without difficulty.\nSubsequently they flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and as we had hoped the orifice had remodeled and essentially there is no obstruction at the level of the previous stent.\nAt the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.\nThen, using a 8\u20139\u201310 millimeter CRE balloon dilated each of the left lower lobe subsegments as well as the left lower lobe main bronchus which improved patency of the subsegments to approximately 50% of normal and left lower lobe bronchus to approximately 80%.\nCryotherapy was then performed with 30 second freeze/thaw cycles to induce tissue sloughing.\nFinally using the super dimension 21-gauge needle we injected a total of 5 mL of Kenalog 10 mg/milliliter solution into the submucosa have areas of significant granulation tissue in hopes of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect to prevent regrowth of granulation tissue.\nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.\nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer patient back to the ICU\n-\tPost-procedure x-ray\n-\tPatient to follow-up with me for repeat bronchoscopy in about a week to remove debris post cryotherapy as well as to assess for evidence of restenosis.", "entities": [[24, 37, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [38, 43,

The upper trachea was normal.\nThe mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction.\nThe distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well.\nThe distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.\nIt appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression.\nTumor debulking  was performed using APC to  \u201cburn and shave\u201d the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent.\nThe right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina.\nThere was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.\nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position.\nPost-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent.\nWe then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.", "entities": [[69, 78, "OBS_ROSE"], [164, 172, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [173, 180, "DEV_STENT"], [202, 220, "PROC_ACTION"], [226, 241, "PROC_ACTION"], [246, 254, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [272, 280, "DEV_STENT"], [305, 323, "OBS_LESION"], [691, 695, "MEAS_SIZE"], [696, 726, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [708, 726, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [915, 920, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [945, 949, "MEAS_SIZE"], [950, 980, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1009, 1020, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1030, 1041, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1256, 1294, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1300, 1313, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1330, 1341, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1346, 1359, "OBS_LESION"], [1374, 1392, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1407, 1429, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1435, 1449, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1464, 1469, "OBS_LESION"], [1485, 1493, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1499, 1506, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1507, 1525, "OBS_LESION"], [1539, 1553, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1564, 1575, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1599, 1618, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1627, 1641, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1646, 1656, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1675, 1699, "OBS_LESION"], [1764, 1779, "PROC_ACTION"], [1801, 1804, "PROC_METHOD"], [1830, 1835, "OBS_LESION"], [1847, 1854, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1878, 1886, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1898, 1909, "PROC_ACTION"], [1990, 1995, "OBS_LESION"], [2000, 2013, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2014, 2019, "OBS_LESION"], [2040, 2043, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2053, 2064, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2073, 2093, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2098, 2116, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2151, 2165, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2198, 2206, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2216, 2227, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2255, 2273, "OBS_LESION"], [2306, 2322, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2331, 2350, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2422, 2430, "DEV_STENT_SIZE"], [2431, 2439, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [2440, 2447, "DEV_STENT"], [2463, 2467, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2475, 2488, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2490, 2497, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2505, 2524, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2529, 2533, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2541, 2559, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2565, 2583, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2608, 2613, "DEV_STENT"], [2666, 2680, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2694, 2700, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2719, 2728, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2762, 2767, "DEV_STENT"], [2780, 2791, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2801, 2808, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2814, 2832, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2874, 2887, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2926, 2947, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2984, 2989, "DEV_STENT"], [3031, 3038, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3040, 3054, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3059, 3072, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3091, 3101, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST"], [3123, 3141, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3289, 3303, "MEDICATION"], [3326, 3331, "DEV_STENT"], [3443, 3452, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3475, 3497, "MEDICATION"], [3668, 3682, "DEV_STENT"], [3768, 3771, "MEAS_SIZE"], [3783, 3786, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3851, 3868, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3874, 3891, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3925, 3929, "MEAS_SIZE"], [3939, 3952, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3960, 3965, "DEV_STENT"]]}

widely patent and clear of debris. .\nAt this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea.\nDual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope.\nThe stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen.\nAn LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space.\nThe exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated.\nThe mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent.\nThe A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm.\nAt this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.\nThe excised 15x50mm silicone stent was cleaned and loaded into the Efer-dumon stent loading system and deployed through the rigid bronchoscope into the previous location without difficulty.\nThe stent was well seated with the proximal limb approximately XXX cm distal to the vocal cords and the airway was 100% patent.\nThe bronchoscope was subsequently removed, and the procedure completed.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Transfer PACU\n\n- D/C home when criteria met\n\n- Will discuss surgical planning with otolaryngology.", "entities": [{"start_offset": 34, "end_offset":

The subglottic area and proximal trachea were normal.\nAt the level of the med trachea there was a large polypoid tumor with a ball valve effect with the base at the left posterior tracheal wall.\nThe tumor was about 90% obstructive of the normal tracheal diameter.\nAdditionally there wer multiple small polypoid lesions surrounding the large obstructive mass mostly on the posterior wall of the trachea but also on the anterior and right tracheal wall.\nThese findings extended for about 3cm. We did not attempt to pass the polypoid lesion with the bronchoscope during the initial inspection.\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator.\nThe T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the obstructive mass at its base.\nWe then inserted the 1.9mm cryotherapy probe through the flexible bronchoscope and attached the probe using cryotherapy to the resected tumor and attempted to extract it through the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe tumor however was too large and repeatedly fell off of the cryoprobe when trying to pull it through the rigid scope.\nWe then switched to the large 2.4mm cryoprobe and again using the same technique were able to pull pieces of the tumor out if a piecemeal fashion and residual pieces of the resected tumor were then extracted with flexible forceps.\nAfter the primary tumor was removed we then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization.\nAt the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 95% open in comparison to unaffected areas.\nWe then were able to complete the distal airway inspection.\nThe lower trachea, right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed.

The tumor was mostly confined to the posterior and left lateral wall. At the distal aspect of the tumor (3cm proximal to the main carina there was an obvious fistulous communication with the esophagus in the left recess between the posterior and lateral tracheal wall.  The distal 3 cm of the trachea appeared normal. There was purulent material in the left mainstem which was suctioned and all airways beyond the trachea appeared normal without evidence of mucosal irregularities of endobronchial disease. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were \nremoved and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea and with bronchoscopic observation placed a 16x60 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent. The stent deployed more distally than expected with the distal edge within the right mainstem and the proximal edge not fully covering the obstruction.\nWe were able to pull the stent proximally but slightly more proximal than expected to cover the upper tracheal obstruction but the distal margin and TE fistula remained exposed.\nAt this point our thought was that the obstruction was covered and that GI would place a stent to cover the fistula.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was removed and GI then attempted through EGD to place the stent but were unable to bypass the esophageal obstruction.\nWe then re-intubated with the tracheoscope and using a similar technique to before and using forceps biopsied the exposed tumor.\nWe then placed a second 16X60 aero SEM into the distal trachea telescoping into the more proximal stent.\nThis resulted in complete occlusion of the fistula and complete opening of the trachea to a normal diameter.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nOnce the patient was felt to be able to adequately protect airway the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nMixed infiltrative tumor of the trachea and TE fistula s/p tracheal stenting with complete recanalization and obstruction of fistula \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await tissue diagnosis\n- Obtain post procedure CXR- TID saline nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent", "entities": [{"span_id": "OBS_LESION_69", "note_id":

We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps.\nThe proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent.\nBoth stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass.\nThe patient\u2019s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula.\nThe airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\n-\tStent infection\n-\tStent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.\n-\tPersistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent \n-\ts/p airway stent removal\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await cultures\n- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula\n- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.", "entities": [{"span_id": "OBS_LESION_24", "note_id": "note_249", "label":

We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps.\nThe proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent.\nBoth stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass.\nThe patient\u2019s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula.\nThe airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\n-\tStent infection\n-\tStent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.\n-\tPersistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent \n-\ts/p airway stent removal\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await cultures\n- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula\n- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.", "entities": [{"id": "OBS_LESION_69", "label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 69,

The patient was placed right side down to protect the left lung and while suctioning blood via a flexible bronchoscope in the ETT.\nVision remained poor and we utilized topical TXA and epi to try to slow the bleeding while using cryotherapy probe to pull blood clots from the airways.\nEventually the bleeding stopped and the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation returned to normal.\nOnce we were able to better visualize the airways we found that the left side had relatively mild blood spillover and at the LC1 carina the transected tumor was seen which was removed piecemeal using the cryotherapy probe.\nSubsequently we began to debulk further into right lung. The right upper lobe was eventually visualized.\nWe attempted to use APC to \"burn and shave\" residual airway tumor however patient would quickly desat with drops in FIO2 required to safely use thermal therapies.\nWe were able to debulk until what was likely the distal aspect of the BI but significant tumor still remained.\nPatient had extremely low reserve and since he continued to desaturate limiting our ability to continue debulk we decided to APC the base or the tumor as well as the residual tumor in the airway wall until we were confident that there was no active bleeding and abort attempts to further debulk for now and to consider returning to the OR at a later date.\nOnce this was accomplished the ETT position was confirmed to be 3cm above the carina.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and there procedure completed. Decision in consultation with anesthesia was for patient to remain intubated for now and transfer to the ICU.\nSpecimens: Right mainstem tumor\nFluids/Blood Products:\nIVF: 1500  EBL: 200cc  Blood Products: None\n Complications: Severe hemorrhage, severe hypoxia, Escalation in level of care.\nRecommendations: \n-\tPatient to remain intubated overnight, with endobronchial blocker at bedside.\n-\tIf no bleeding overnight plan to extubate tomorrow.\n-\tWill need to discuss options moving forward. Given the extent of the tumor risk/benefit ratio of re-attempting debulking needs to be carefully considered along with alternative options such as radiotherapy.", "entities": [[36, 50, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [76, 88, "OBS_LESION"], [115, 120, "OBS_LESION"], [140, 160, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [183, 201, "PROC_ACTION"], [207, 230, "PROC_ACTION"], [244, 249, "OBS_LESION"], [265, 279, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [697, 702, "MEAS_SIZE"], [715, 733, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [756, 767, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [760, 767, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [841, 862, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [888, 906, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [948, 955, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [957, 966, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1048, 1062, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1093, 1112, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1119, 1129, "OBS_LESION"], [1164, 1170, "OBS_LESION"], [1230, 1245, "OBS_LESION"], [1239, 1245, "OBS_LESION"], [1256, 1276, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1282, 1288, "OBS_LESION"], [1380, 1398, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1421, 1435, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1569, 1580, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1595, 1598, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1637, 1640, "MEAS_SIZE"], [1641, 1644, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1700, 1709, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1743, 1764, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1772, 1775, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1822, 1825, "MEDICATION"], [1830, 1833, "MEDICATION"], [1874, 1891, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2143, 2153, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2169, 2174, "OBS_LESION"], [2222, 2239, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2266, 2272, "PROC_ACTION"], [2286, 2296, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2366, 2369, "PROC_METHOD"], [2406, 2411, "OBS_LESION"], [2525, 2531, "PROC_ACTION"], [2579, 2581, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2598, 2603, "OBS_LESION"], [2724, 2730, "PROC_ACTION"], [2745, 2748, "PROC_METHOD"], [2765, 2770, "OBS_LESION"], [2795, 2800, "OBS_LESION"], [2908, 2914, "PROC_ACTION"], [3007, 3010, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3243, 3263, "OBS_LESION"], [3258, 3263, "OBS_LESION"], [3292, 3296, "MEAS_VOL"], [3303, 3308, "MEAS_VOL"], [3347, 3364, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [3366, 3380, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [3475, 3496, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3634, 3639, "OBS_LESION"], [3676, 3682, "PROC_ACTION"]]}

We then wedged the bronchoscope in the left lower lobe for 2 minutes and reassessed.\nAt that point the bleeding had stopped and we felt that given the distal airway disease (likely radiation induced) and only segmental obstruction, the risk/benefit ratio of continued attempts at dilatation favored abstaining from further intervention.\nAt this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nRecommendations:\n- Patient to PACU for recovery\n- Await culture results\n- Follow-up with primary pulmonologist", "entities": [[24, 33, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [34, 42, "OBS_FINDING"], [86, 95, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [96, 104, "OBS_FINDING"], [126, 147, "PROC_METHOD"], [148, 166, "PROC_ACTION"], [181, 196, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [197, 205, "OBS_FINDING"], [219, 228, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [229, 240, "OBS_FINDING"], [461, 479, "PROC_METHOD"], [560, 569, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [589, 621, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [744, 751, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [756, 762, "OBS_FINDING"], [778, 807, "OBS_FINDING"], [813, 825, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [851, 862, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [885, 897, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [925, 939, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [980, 991, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [993, 1005, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1007, 1023, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1080, 1086, "OBS_FINDING"], [1103, 1109, "OBS_LESION"], [1119, 1126, "OBS_LESION"], [1158, 1179, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1198, 1210, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1239, 1246, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1274, 1288, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1297, 1312, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1323, 1347, "OBS_FINDING"], [1355, 1366, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1375, 1383, "OBS_FINDING"], [1395, 1414, "OBS_FINDING"], [1422, 1432, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1437, 1447, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1449, 1463, "PROC_ACTION"], [1485, 1500, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1518, 1533, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1551, 1559, "OBS_FINDING"], [1576, 1599, "OBS_FINDING"], [1616, 1633, "OBS_FINDING"], [1639, 1663, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1672, 1680, "OBS_FINDING"], [1704, 1712, "OBS_FINDING"], [1720, 1743, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1751, 1761, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1773, 1781, "OBS_FINDING"], [1783, 1786, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1795, 1818, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1832, 1838, "OBS_LESION"], [1848, 1855, "OBS_LESION"], [1887, 1908, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1958, 1981, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2001, 2030, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2053, 2061, "OBS_FINDING"], [2073, 2096, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2104, 2119, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2131, 2141, "PROC_ACTION"], [2165, 2193, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2199, 2215, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST"], [2219, 2227, "OBS_FINDING"], [2233, 2244, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2249, 2256, "OBS_FINDING"], [2269, 2281, "OBS_FINDING"], [2311, 2317, "PROC_ACTION"], [2322, 2345, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2363, 2374, "OBS_FINDING"], [2386, 2395, "PROC_ACTION"], [2400, 2407, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2430, 2434, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2440, 2449, "PROC_ACTION"], [2462, 2470, "OBS_FINDING"], [2502, 2526, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2547, 2559, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2567, 2582, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2587, 2596, "MEAS_TIME"], [2631, 2651, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2737, 2758, "OBS_FINDING"], [2808, 2818, "PROC_ACTION"], [2917, 2935, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2940, 2952, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"]]}

The patients known tracheal 12X20 Bonostent was visualized with the proximal edge abutting the distal aspect of the true vocal folds.\nThere was significant thick dry mucous with mild obstruction however the stent was otherwise patent.\nJust distal to the stent was a 4cm long complex tracheal stenosis with circumferential friable and edematous mucosa.\nAn \u201cA-shaped\u201d deformity was visualized within the segment consistent with tracheal cartilage injury along with overlying granulation tissue creating a slit light obstruction of approximately 80% of the normal tracheal lumen.\nThe mid to distal trachea was normal and full inspection of the distal tracheobronchial tree revealed no other abnormalities and all bronchial segments were widely patent to at least the 1st sub-segmental branch.\nThe laryngeal mask airway was removed and a a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supra-glottic space.\nRigid alligator forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe stent was subsequently removed without difficulty.  The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced through the vocal cords into the subglottic space and attached the jet ventilator.\nBalloon dilatation of the stenotic segment was performed with a phased 8-9-10 Merit dilatational balloon.\nDue to the deformity and lack of cartilaginous structure this only provided mild additional benefit.\nThe 10 mm rigid bronchosocpe was then telescoped into the tracheoscope and approximated to the level of the most significant stenosis.\nThe beveled tip was used to gently debulk granulation tissue with an apple coring technique.\nAt this point a 12 X 40 bonostent was placed under direct visualization with the proximal edge at the level of the cricoid cartilage about 2 cm distal to the true vocal folds and the distal edge 1 cm beyond the distal stenotic segment.\nBalloon dilatation of stent was performed using a phased 12-13.5-15 Merit dilatational balloon.\nFollowing dilatation the trachea was widely patent with a luminal diameter approximately 95% of the normal.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed and the LMA re-inserted.\nFinal inspection of the airway was performed and images captures after which the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.

{"id": "note_258", "text": "NOTE_ID:  note_258 SOURCE_FILE: note_258.txt PROCEDURE TECHNIQUE: Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions, there was extrinsic compression noted in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which precluded deeper visual inspection of suspected endobronchial disease within the segment. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11L lymph node. Further details regarding nodal size are in the table below. The EBUS scope was positioned in the origin of the left lower lobe and turned posteriorly to visualize the lung mass abutting the airway which measured 31.5mm in short axis diameter. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. We then reintroduced the EBUS scope into the left lower lobe and visualized the mass abutting the airway and EBUS guided sampling was performed of the mass with the EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation yielded tissue concerning for malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology and additional needle passes were performed for molecular studies. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. There were no complications.

There was tumor infiltration within the distal trachea just proximal to the main carina on the right lateral wall with slowly oozing blood visualized.\nThat main carina was involved on the right side. The left sided aiways were normal.\nThe proximal right mainstem was completely obstructed with friable enbdobronchial tumor APC was used to burn and shave the tumor and flexible forceps were used for biopsy.\nAs we slowly debulked the tumor it became clear that the involvement was extensive.\nUsing the P90 slim bronchoscope we were able to bypass tumor using saline aliquots to stent the airway open and eventually could visualize the basilar segments of the lower lobe where persistent tumor was seen.\nUsing a forgery balloon and the pullback method we were able to dilate the airway slightly and then using an 8,9,10 CRE balloon gently dilated the BI and RLL bronchus.\nWhile bleeding was encountered it was not brisk and was controlled with tropical TXA, epi and cold saline.\nWhile considering stent placement the patient\u2019s blood pressure began to slowly drop despite increasing vasopressor requirement and patient went into PEA/Asystole.\nCode blue was called and CRP initiated.

The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.\nThe trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp.\nThe tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal;\nthere are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  The proximal and mid left mainstem were normal.\nIn the distal left mainstem a white fungating tumor was seen causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and extending from the left lower lobe bronchus to causing complete obstruction of the lingula and 80% obstruction of the left mainstem.\nThe LMA was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator.\nThe rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.\nWe then utilized cryoextraction to remove large pieces of tumor piece meal.\nMost of the superficial tumor was avascular and did not bleed but as we continued debulking into less necrotic tumor mild bleeding occurred and was treated with cold saline flushes.\nAfter extensive debulking we were able to advance the bronchoscope into the lingula were some purulent secretions were seen and performed mini BAL.\nThe tumor however extended into the subsegments of the lingula and deemed likely not salvageable with endobronchial treatment alone.\nAPC was then used to coagulate the residual superficial layer of oozing tumor.\nAt the end of the procedure distal left mainstem was only 15% obstructed.\nThe left upper lobe proper (anterior and apical posterior segments) were completely patent.\nThe lingula was 80% obstructed and the left lower lobe remained completely obstructed with distal tumor.\nOnce we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\nRecommendations:\nTransfer to PACU and then home once discharge criteria met.\nWill discuss with oncology if biopsy samples obtained during procedure need any specific mutational analysis.\nDefer to oncology regarding medical and radiation treatment. \nWill monitor for symptoms or radiographic signs of tumor regrowth and possible need for repeat debulking to salvage left upper lobe.", "entities": [{"start": 69, "end": 88, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "Malignant lung mass"}, {"start": 94, "end": 109, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "left lower lobe"}, {"start": 122,

Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.\nAdditionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina.\nThe right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator.\nThe T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment.\nAfter these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion.\nWe then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization.\nAt the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed.

Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation(CPT 31641)\nINDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.\nAfter administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx.\nWe then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.\nAdditionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina.\nThe right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator.\nThe T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment.\nAfter these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion.\nWe then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization.\nAt the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.\nOf note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago.\nI suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\nRecommendations: \n\u2022\tTransfer patient back to ward room \n\u2022\tAwait final pathology results  \n\u2022\tWill need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.", "entities": [{"start": 115, "end": 133, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "ERFORMED: \n1.
