Vocal cords were moving bilaterally.\nA total of 4 mL of 2% lidocaine was instilled onto the vocal cords.\nSubglottis: granulation tissue along the left portion and right portion that was soft but cause approximately 15% obstruction.\nThis extended approximately 1-2 cm. \nTrachea:  The proximal and mid trachea are abnormal.\nEvidence of skin graft from the 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock position;\nhair follicles and longer hair stubbles seen within the airway.\nNumerous sutures visualized with area of pedunculated tissue around suture sites.  No evidence of dehiscence or necrosis seen.\nMain Carina: Sharp\nRight Lung Proximal Airways:  There is mild webbing of tissue at RUL take-off.\nLeft Lung Proximal Airways:  Normal anatomic branching to first subsegmental level.\nNo evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.\nMucosa: Trachea as described above.  More distal airways are normal.\nSecretions: Moderate, thin, and clear.  All secretions were suctioned to clear (therapeutic aspiration).\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, left lower lobe from mucus.\nA jag wire was introduced into the iGel and advanced to the LLL.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and the jag wire left in place.\nA bona stent 14 x 60 mm stent was deployed under direct visualization into the trachea.\nFollowing deployment the stent was approximately 0.5 cm more distal than desired.\nStent revision was performed 0.5 cm proximally with forceps.

Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).\nInstilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.\nSamples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n \nNeck Ultrasound was performed to evaluate for any abnormal vessel, mass, structures at the site of percutaneous tracheostomy.\nThere were no significant vessels/mass were noted overlying the tracheostomy site on examination from the laryngeal prominence to the sternal notch.\nThe bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization.\nThe inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized.\nNext, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\nLidocaine 1% 3ml ml was injected into the anterior neck.\nA 1 cm incision was made horizontally with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.\nSuture (3-0 prolene) was placed around the incision site to create a Rummel tourniquet.\nThe introducer needle was then passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization.\nNext, a J-wire was passed through the catheter, also visualized with the bronchoscope.\nThe site was then dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.\nThe 14 Fr dilator was then removed

Consent signed.\nDetails of Procedure Performed:  \n \nThe patient remained in the ICU with a previously placed single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nThe patient was positioned supine with a padded shoulder roll in place, the head of bed elevated, and the neck moderately extended.\nA surgical brief was performed and the level of inspired fraction of oxygen was reduced to 40%.\nPatient remained on VV ECMO support. After adequate anesthesia, landmarks were palpated including the thyroid notch, cricoid, and suprasternal notch.\nNeck ultrasound was performed to confirm vascular anatomy. Exposure was excellent.\nThe anterior neck was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. \n \nA surgical time out was performed.\n5mL of 1% lidocaine was injected 2-3 cm above the sternal notch.\nIt was made higher due to the known partially high-riding innominate.\nA 3cm horizontal skin incision was made with a #15 blade knife in a natural, relaxed skin tension line midway between the cricoid cartilage and the sternal notch.\nBovie cautery was used to dissect through the platysma and down to the strap muscles, with effort made to avoid the anterior jugular veins.\nThere were two vertical engorged veins along the midline raphe with a bridging vein between then.\nThe bridging vein was dissected, suture ligated, and divided. This allowed visualization of the midline raphe.\nThe strap muscles were separated vertically at the midline with Bovie cautery. The strap muscles are retracted laterally.\nUsing a combination of blunt and careful cautery midline dissection, the anterior tracheal wall was freed of soft tissue.\nThe innominate artery was identified and protected. There was good soft tissue between the innominate and the trachea which was not disturbed.\nThe trachea was palpated to find the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings.\nThere was adequate distance between the innominate artery and the planned insertion site.\nUnder bronchoscopic guidance, the endotracheal tube cuff was deflated and was pulled back below the level of the vocal cords.\nA finder needle was placed through the anterior trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilaginous rings.\nOnce confirmed by bronchoscopy, a seldinger technique was used to serially dilate the tracheotomy over a wire and to place a # 7 cuffed shiley tracheostomy.\nThe tracheostomy cuff was inflated. Cross table ventilation was performed and the tracheostomy placement was confirmed by bronchoscopy through the tracheostomy as well as CO2 return on the anesthesia monitor.\nThe tracheostomy inner cannula was then placed. Surgicel was placed in the wound bed though hemostasis was great but plan to resume anticoagulation very shortly.\nThe tracheostomy was secured with loose 2-0 prolene sutures to the skin and tracheostomy straps to maintain airway but prevent skin pressure injuries.\nThe endotracheal tube was then withdrawn completely. The tracheostomy obturator was provided to the bedside care team.\nThe patient remained in the ICU in critical condition.

(confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n  \nThe laryngeal mask airway is in good position.\nPharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.\nLarynx: Mild edema and erythema\nVocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions\nTrachea: Normal.\nMain Carina: Sharp\nRight Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.\nNo evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.\nLeft Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental

right.\nERYTHEMATOUS AND EDEMATOUS SUPRAGLOTTIC SPACE\n \n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).\nInstilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.\nSamples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n \nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA.\nThe patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the subglottic posterior trachea where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging.\nNo suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspeciton with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope.\nPOSTERIOR MEMBRANE DEFECT\nAdvanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation.\nThe defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum.\nThe scope was subsequently introduced into the esophagus to evaluate for esophageal injury.\nWith Gastroenterology present, the length of the esophagus was examined and no esophageal defect/injury was identified.\nDecision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed.\nThe black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth.\nThe vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them.\nOnce the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed.\nIntubation was easy. \n \n \nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\n \n \t \nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect\t 8 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom \t2.5 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina\t3 cm\n \nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion as described above.\nIntubation was easy. \n \nA silicone Y-stent (16mm x 13mm x 13mm) was initially modified to have tracheal portion cover the defect with short bronchial limbs for migration prevention.\nHowever, significant difficulty was encountered advancing the stent into the deployer, eventually causing a mild tear of a bronchial limb.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular tracheal stent measuring 16mmx 45mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea.\nThe rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place.\n12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 15 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).\nTotal 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.\nSILICONE STENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEDURE \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\nAt the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the

Purulent secretions were seen throughout the airways.\nOnce secretions were suctioned inspection of the right sided airways should multiple small endobronchial nodular lesions concerning for airway metastasis.\nOn the left in the mid left mainstem a 1.5cm fistula was seen at the medial aspect of the posterior wall.\nDistally (similar to what was seen on the right) were multiple small endobronchial lesions with an appearance suggestive of malignancy.\nMultiple nodules from the left and right side were biopsied with flexible forceps and placed in formalin.\nAt this point we measured the length of the fistula and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the fistula within the left mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the selected area required to cover the fistula with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 14x30 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed slightly too proximally with the distal edge just covering the fistula.\nWe then decided to place a second 14x40 Aero stent into the previously place stent to better cover the obstruction.\nThis was done in a similar fashion. On inspection after placement the originally placed stent was noted to have been pushed distally by the second stent (more distal than desired and obstructing the orifice of the left upper and lower lobe. We then removed the 14x40 stent by grasping the proximal edge with forceps. The stent could not be retracted through the tracheostomy so the trach tube was removed and then the stent was pulled through the stoma, after which re re-inserted the trach over a bronchoscope and re-attached it to the ventilator. We then retraced the remaining 14x30 mm \nAero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent into proper position (within the left mainstem covering the fistula) with forceps. Once this was done and we were satisfied with the final result the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. We then turned the patient over to anesthesia service to recover and transfer back to the ICU.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to ICU\n- Await tissue diagnosis from biopsied endobronchial nodules\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- TID saline nebulizers along with ensuring oxygen is humidified to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.", "entities":

The staff physician was present throughout the entire procedure.\n===========================================\n \nUnder sterile prep and draping, the abdomen was evaluated and 2 cm below the costal margin on the left, the likely point of insertion was identified.\nUltrasound was used and hepatic tissue was identified just under the standard/traditional PEG insertion site.\nTRADITIONAL INSERTION SITE\n \n \nAs such, a new more lateral insertion site was chosen and no hepatic tissue was identified on ultrasound.\nPROPOSED INSERTION SITE\n \n \nThe scope was introduced through the mouth without difficulty and with continuous insufflation, the stomach was reached within 10 seconds.\nThen, the point of digital pressure was identified in the stomach and transillumination was accomplished successfully and without any doubts.\nAt this point, a 1cm incision was carried out in the skin and a 14ga angiocath was introduced.\nUsing modified Seldinger technique, the angiocath was advanced and a wire was introduced.\nUsing pull through technique, the guide wire was pulled through the mouth and linked to the 20Fr PEG catheter in usual fashion.\nThereafter, the wire was pulled through the abdominal wall and the PEG tube positioned correctly with the bumper at 1.5 cm.\nThe remaining air was suctioned out and complete apposition of the stomach and esophagus was seen. There were no complications.\nThe total procedural time was 20 minutes.\n \nINSTRUCTIONS:\nPEG can be used for medications 6 hrs post procedure (@2200)\nPEG (or NG tube) can be used for feeds 6 hrs post procedure (@2200).\nNo enteral feeding prior.\nOK to restart systemic anticoagulation @2200, if needed.\n \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\nThere were no immediate complications.

All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Pertinent laboratory studies and imaging were reviewed. A procedural time-out was performed.\n\nThe patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position on the procedural bed, with pressure points appropriately padded. The right-sided pleural entry site was identified using ultrasound guidance. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (ChloraPrep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry site was infiltrated with 20 mL of 1% lidocaine. A 1-cm skin incision was made, and blunt dissection was carried down to the pleural space. Finger sweep revealed pleural adhesions, which were lysed bluntly.\n\nAn 8-mm disposable primary port was placed in the right fourth intercostal space at the mid-axillary line. After air entrainment and lung deflation, an Olympus semi-rigid pleuroscope was introduced through the trocar into the pleural cavity. Suction was applied, and approximately 1,600 mL of serosanguinous pleural fluid was removed.\n\nThe pleura appeared abnormal, with areas of isolated nodularity and plaques most consistent with pachypleuritis. No significant adhesions were present. Multiple biopsies of abnormal posterior parietal pleura were obtained using forceps. Additionally, a large pleural specimen was obtained using an electrocautery knife. Approximately nine total biopsies were obtained and sent for histopathological examination. Minimal bleeding was observed.\n\nFollowing biopsies, talc pleurodesis was performed using a combination of talc poudrage and talc slurry, with a total of 5 grams of talc instilled. The primary port was then removed, and a 24-French chest tube was placed through the existing stoma, sutured in place, and connected to a pleuro-vac. The chest tube was dressed and covered with a transparent dressing.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\nA post-procedure chest radiograph demonstrated the chest tube in appropriate position, with the proximal side hole just at the pleural wall and a trace apical pneumothorax.\n\nComplications:\nNone immediate\n\nEstimated Blood Loss:\n10 mL\n\nPost-Procedure Diagnosis:\nPleural effusion\n\nRecommendations:\n\nAdmit to inpatient service (planned)\n\nChest tube to suction; plan for removal once output is <150 mL/day\n\nPain management following talc pleurodesis, including narcotics as needed\n\nAwait pathology results\n\nInpatient Interventional Pulmonology consult team to follow", "entities": [{"start": 66, "end": 77, "label": "LATERALITY", "text": "Right-sided"}, {"start": 78, "end": 98, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "medical thoracoscopy"}, {"start": 100, "end": 111, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "pleuroscopy"}, {"start": 118, "end": 134, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "pleural biopsies"}, {"start": 136, "end": 152, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "talc pleurodesis"}, {"start": 158, "end": 178, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "chest tube insertion"}, {"start": 192, "end": 218, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "Exudative pleural effusion"}, {"start": 294, "end": 303, "label": "MEDICATION", "text": "Lidocaine"}, {"start": 308, "end": 313, "label": "MEAS_VOL", "text": "20 mL"}, {"start": 741, "end": 745, "label": "LATERALITY", "text": "left"}, {"start": 843, "end": 854, "label": "LATERALITY", "text": "right-sided"}, {"start": 955, "end": 978, "label": "MEDICATION", "text": "chlorhexidine gluconate"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1082, "label": "MEDICATION", "text": "lidocaine"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1250, "label": "MEAS_SIZE", "text": "8-mm"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1274, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "primary port"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1298, "label": "LATERALITY", "text": "right"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1323, "label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "text": "fourth intercostal space"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1425, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "Olympus semi-rigid pleuroscope"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1532, "label": "MEAS_VOL", "text": "1,600 mL"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1564, "label": "SPECIMEN", "text": "pleural fluid"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1642, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "nodularity"}, {"start": 1647, "end": 1654, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "plaques"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1690, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "pachypleuritis"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1748, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "biopsies"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1814, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "forceps"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1897, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "electrocautery knife"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2059, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "talc pleurodesis"}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2110, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "talc poudrage"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2126, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "talc slurry"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2221, "label": "DEV_CATHETER_SIZE", "text": "24-French"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2232, "label": "DEV_CATHETER", "text": "chest tube"}, {"start": 2309, "end": 2319, "label": "DEV_DEVICE", "text": "pleuro-vac"}, {"start": 2325, "end": 2335, "label": "DEV_CATHETER", "text": "chest tube"}, {"start": 2592, "end": 2604, "label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "text": "pneumothorax"}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2665, "label": "MEAS_VOL", "text": "10 mL"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2709, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "Pleural effusion"}]}

{"id": "note_141", "text": "Preoperative Diagnosis:\nNear-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nNear-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia\n\nProcedure Performed:\nRigid bronchoscopy with silicone Y-stent placement\n\nIndication:\nNear-complete tracheal obstruction requiring urgent intervention\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure\n\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure after discussion, in lay terms, of the indications, procedural details, risks, benefits, and alternatives. The patient acknowledged understanding and agreed to proceed.\n\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. Initial airway inspection was performed using an ultra-slim Olympus P190 flexible bronchoscope inserted through the patient’s customized 5.5-mm tracheostomy tube. At the distal margin of the tracheostomy tube, approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina, there was a ridge of granulation tissue occluding approximately 80% of the tracheostomy tube lumen. Distal to this obstruction, there was severe tracheobronchial malacia with near-complete collapse of the distal trachea and right mainstem bronchus, and approximately 75% obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus. The airway mucosa was diffusely erythematous and inflamed.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope and tracheostomy tube were removed, and an attempt was made to insert a 14-mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma; this was unsuccessful due to the small size of the stoma. The tracheostomy tube was reinserted, and rigid bronchoscopy was then attempted via the oral route. However, the patient had severely distorted upper airway anatomy and significant edema, making visualization of the posterior pharynx and vocal cords impossible. Attempts were made to insert progressively smaller rigid bronchoscopes, down to a 6-mm scope, but these were unsuccessful due to a fixed stricture within the tracheostomy tract. At this point, otolaryngology was consulted intraoperatively for assistance with surgical extension of the tracheostomy stoma. Otolaryngology also attempted visualization of the vocal cords using suspension laryngoscopy but was unsuccessful. The tracheostomy stoma was surgically extended; however, due to extensive scar tissue and concern for injury to the anterior trachea, the stoma could not be enlarged sufficiently to accommodate a large rigid bronchoscope. It was, however, extended enough to allow insertion of smaller rigid bronchoscopes. A 6-mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma and advanced to the main carina. Due to the small diameter of the scope, it was not possible to introduce usable instruments or deploy a silicone stent through the rigid bronchoscope. The decision was therefore made to deploy the smallest available silicone Y-stent (14 × 10 × 10 mm) through the tracheostomy stoma. The bronchial limbs were compressed with rigid forceps, and the stent was advanced toward the main carina under direct visualization using a flexible bronchoscope inserted through the left bronchial limb of the stent. After measurement, the tracheal limb was trimmed to 30 mm, the left bronchial limb to 20 mm, and the right bronchial limb to 10 mm. Advancement and seating of the stent were extremely challenging due to the patient’s severely narrowed airways. Multiple techniques were employed, including manipulation with rigid optical forceps, advancement using Kelly clamps by otolaryngology under direct bronchoscopic visualization, gentle balloon dilation using a CRE balloon, and eventual insertion of a slightly larger 8-mm rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma and into the stent to help seat the bronchial limbs. During this maneuver, a small airway tear was visualized along the lateral aspect of the right mainstem bronchus, approximately 0.5 cm proximal to the right upper lobe orifice. This was felt to be caused by the distal edge of the right bronchial limb of the stent. Consideration was given to placement of a metallic stent to cover the defect; however, given concerns regarding metallic stents in benign airway disease, this was deferred. The patient received 1 gram of cefazolin intraoperatively. Thoracic surgery was consulted by phone, and based on their experience, recommended conservative management provided there was no evidence of pneumothorax. A portable chest radiograph demonstrated no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\n\nThe stent was slightly repositioned to optimize seating at the main carina. There was mild tenting of the distal right bronchial limb at the site of the airway tear that could not be corrected; otherwise, the stent was well seated, with resolution of distal tracheal and mainstem bronchial obstruction and patent distal airways. The patient’s tracheostomy tube was reinserted under direct visualization through the stoma and positioned within the tracheal limb of the stent, where it was secured. The procedure was then concluded, and the patient was transferred to the ICU. Postoperative Course\n\nUpon arrival in the ICU, the patient was initially stable but subsequently developed an episode of acute hypoxia with transient PaO₂ <50%, associated with difficulty ventilating. This resolved rapidly with manual bag ventilation. Flexible bronchoscopy performed through the tracheostomy tube demonstrated no significant stent obstruction, though foamy, blood-tinged secretions were present, consistent with acute pulmonary edema. A chest radiograph obtained during this event showed no pneumothorax. The patient received 20 mg of furosemide intravenously, and the condom catheter was exchanged for a Foley catheter, resulting in brisk diuresis and significant improvement in tidal volumes. Persistently elevated ventilator pressures were felt to be related in part to the small tracheostomy tube. Under bronchoscopic visualization, the tracheostomy tube was exchanged for a 7.0 Bivona tracheostomy tube, which was positioned midway within the stent. This resulted in improved airway compliance and ventilation.\n\nThe patient was subsequently deemed stable. After discussion with the patient’s parents, care was transitioned to the ICU team. Complications:\nSmall lateral right mainstem bronchial tear\n\nRecommendations\n\nContinue positive-pressure ventilation overnight\n\nEmpiric vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam for 7 days to prevent infection related to airway injury\n\nObtain noncontrast CT chest once the patient is stable enough for transport\n\nPlan for repeat bedside flexible bronchoscopy on or around 4/1/2019, or sooner if clinical concerns arise\n\nNotify the Interventional Pulmonology team immediately for any airway issues\n\nNote that the silicone stent is radiolucent and will not be visible on chest radiograph; CT or bronchoscopy should be used for evaluation of suspected stent-related complications\n\nAdminister 3% saline nebulizers three times daily starting tonight and continuing while the stent remains in place to reduce secretion burden and prevent stent obstruction\n\nIf tracheostomy tube removal or replacement is required, this must be performed under direct bronchoscopic visualization to ensure correct positioning within the stent and to avoid kinking or obstruction\n\nInterventional Pulmonology will continue to follow", "entities": [{"span_id": "OBS_LESION_70",

{"id": "note_142", "text": "Procedure Name: Bronchoscopy\n\nIndications:\n\nHilar mass\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral anesthesia with topical anesthesia using 2% lidocaine to the tracheobronchial tree (8 mL).\nSee anesthesia record for administered medications.\n\nPre-Procedure Assessment\n\nThe procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was explained to the patient.\nAll questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol.\nA history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record.\nRelevant laboratory studies and radiographic imaging were reviewed. A procedural time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing administration of intravenous anesthetic medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q180 slim video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via a laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was subsequently introduced through the mouth via the laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\nProcedure Description and Findings\n\nThe laryngeal mask airway was in normal position.\nThe vocal cords moved normally with respiration. The subglottic space was normal.\nThe trachea was of normal caliber, and the carina was sharp.\nThe tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level.\nBronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal, with no endobronchial lesions identified, except for extrinsic compression of the left upper lobe posterior segment.\nNo significant secretions were present.\n\nEndobronchial Ultrasound Findings\n\nThe bronchoscope was withdrawn and replaced with the EBUS bronchoscope to perform ultrasound evaluation.\nA systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was conducted, revealing visible lymph nodes.\nLymph node sizing and sampling were performed using endobronchial ultrasound with an Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22-gauge needle.\nSpecimens were sent for routine cytopathologic evaluation.\n\nThe left upper lobe mass measured 24.2 mm by EBUS and 24 mm by CT.\nPET imaging was not available. On ultrasound, the mass appeared hypoechoic, heterogeneous, irregularly shaped, with sharp margins.\nMultiple surrounding vessels were noted, limiting safe needle trajectory. A small window for safe needle access was identified, and the mass was biopsied with a single pass using a 22-gauge needle.\nROSE preliminary analysis demonstrated atypical cells. However, brisk bleeding occurred following the first needle pass, and no additional ultrasound-guided passes were performed.\nAn esophageal approach was attempted but did not allow adequate visualization of the mass.\nThe EBUS bronchoscope was withdrawn, and a therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced.\nA conventional TBNA was attempted in the region of extrinsic compression in the left upper lobe posterior segment;\nhowever, the return was bloody, and no further passes were performed.\n\nAll samples were sent to cytopathology for review.\nComplications\n\nNo immediate complications.\n\nEstimated Blood Loss\n\nLess than 5 mL.\n\nImpression\n\nNormal bronchoscopic examination except for extrinsic compression of the left upper lobe posterior segment\n\nLymph node sizing and limited sampling performed via EBUS-TBNA\n\nPost-Procedure Diagnosis\n\nTechnically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy\n\nThe patient remained stable throughout the procedure and was transferred in good condition to the post-bronchoscopy recovery area for observation until discharge criteria were met.\nPreliminary findings were discussed with the patient.

{"id": "note_144", "text": "Procedure Name: Bronchoscopy\nIndications: Metastatic lung cancer; hemoptysis\n\nPre-Anesthesia Assessment:\n\nA history and physical examination were performed.\nPatient medications and allergies were reviewed. The risks and benefits of the procedure, as well as sedation options and associated risks, were discussed with the patient’s parent.\nAll questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained. Patient identification and the proposed procedure were verified prior to the procedure by the physician, nurse, and technician in the procedure room.\nMental status examination revealed the patient to be alert and oriented. Airway examination demonstrated a normal oropharyngeal airway.\nRespiratory examination was clear to auscultation. Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, S3, or S4.\nThe ASA physical status classification was III (a patient with severe systemic disease).\nAfter reviewing risks and benefits, the patient was deemed an appropriate candidate to undergo the procedure under general anesthesia.\nImmediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was reassessed and found to be appropriate for sedation.\nHeart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, adequacy of ventilation, and response to care were continuously monitored throughout the procedure.\nThe patient’s physical status was reassessed following completion of the procedure.\nProcedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were again explained to the patient, and informed consent was documented per institutional protocol.\nA history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n\nFollowing administration of intravenous medications per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q180 slim video bronchoscope was introduced through the rigid bronchoscope after removal of the telescope and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree bilaterally.\nThe T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope was subsequently introduced and advanced into the airways. The procedure was accomplished without difficulty.\nProcedure Description:\n\nLeft Lung Abnormalities:\nA partially obstructing airway abnormality (approximately 40% luminal obstruction) was identified at the entrance to the left lower lobe.\nTumor debulking was performed using an electrocautery snare with successful coagulation.\nUpon completion, the left lower lobe entrance was fully patent.\nFindings:\n\nRight Lung Abnormalities:\nA nearly obstructing airway abnormality (>90% luminal obstruction) was identified at the entrance to the right lower lobe.\nTumor destruction was performed using argon plasma coagulation at 25 watts and 0.3 L/min, in combination with an electrocautery probe and electrocautery snare.\nThis resulted in successful recanalization.\n\nUpon completion of intervention, both the left lower lobe and right lower lobe entrances were 100% patent.\nResidual tumor remained within the anterior and lateral basal segments of the right lower lobe;\nthis tissue appeared chronic and extended into the peripheral airways and was not amenable to further intervention.\nThe right lower lobe superior segment, medial basal segment, and posterior segment were fully patent.\nTherapeutic aspiration was performed at the conclusion of the procedure to remove retained blood and secretions, with good hemostasis achieved.\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Minimal\n\nAdditional Findings:\n\nMetastatic renal cell carcinoma with endobronchial tumors involving the left lower lobe and right lower lobe

Blood was noted within the endotracheal tube and throughout the airway, beginning near the laryngeal inlet. The tip of the endotracheal tube was visualized approximately 3 cm proximal to the main carina. Diffuse blood was present throughout the airways, with multiple early clots partially obstructing the bronchi. These were suctioned via the bronchoscope. All left- and right-sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental level and were patent following suctioning, with the exception of a small foreign body identified in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe. This material was suctioned from the airway and appeared consistent with tissue of unclear origin.

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth.\nThe vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp.\nSomewhat thick secretions were seen throughout the airways. The left sided airway anatomy was normal without evidence of endobronchial disease.\nOn the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just proximal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe.\nWithin that segment fibrotic endoluminal obstruction was seen but all other airways did not have visual endobronchial disease to at least the first sub-segmental level.\nDue to difficulty with maintaining position of LMA (edentulous) the decision was made to convert to endotracheal intubation.\nThis was performed over the bronchoscope without difficulty and the ETT was secured approximately 2 cm above the main carina.\nOnce the ETT was connected to ventilator, The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted through the tube and advanced to the orifice of the accessory left lower lobe bronchus and the radial ultrasound was advanced through the scope into the sub-segment and a concentric view of the lesion was visualized within the segment.\nMultiple forceps biopsies were then performed. The lesion was extremely firm and samples were relatively scant.\nWe then utilized the super-dimension 21G peripheral needle and the 19G Olympus peripheral needle to obtain a total of 6 endobronchial needle biopsies of the lesion which were placed in formalin.\nAfter adequate samples were obtained repeat inspection was performed and no evidence of bleeding or other complications were seen.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.  \nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.\nPost Procedure Diagnosis:\n- Flexible bronchoscopy with

We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscope and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway.\nUsing navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within apico-posterior branch of left upper lobe.\nRadial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion.\nAlthough we were able to navigate directly to the lesion with navigation the radial probe view was suboptimal.\nBiopsy was performed initially with triple needle brush and TBNA needle.\nROSE did not reveal evidence to support that we were within the lesion.\nMultiple attempts were made to manipulate the catheter and biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, and forceps, brush under fluoroscopic visualization.\nThe specimens reviewed on-site remained suboptimal.  Multiple forceps biopsies were performed within the location of the lesion and placed in cell-block.\nAfter which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter.\nWe then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None \nCOMPLICATIONS:                 None\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n- S/P bronchoscopy with biopsy and lavage.\n- Suboptimal navigational localization \nRECOMMENDATIONS\n- Transfer to post-procedural unit\n- Post-procedure CXR\n- D/C home once criteria met\n- Await pathology", "entities": [[70, 85, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [86, 102, "OBS_LESION"], [130, 145, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [146, 162, "OBS_LESION"], [186, 207, "PROC_ACTION"], [213, 239, "PROC_METHOD"], [246, 258, "PROC_METHOD"], [263, 267, "PROC_METHOD"], [282, 314, "PROC_ACTION"], [316, 337, "PROC_ACTION"], [342, 365, "PROC_ACTION"], [395, 419, "PROC_METHOD"], [504, 516, "PROC_METHOD"], [548, 577, "PROC_ACTION"], [689, 714, "PROC_ACTION"], [744, 785, "PROC_METHOD"], [817, 832, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [833, 844, "OBS_LESION"], [873, 875, "MEDICATION"], [985, 1006, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1012, 1035, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1101, 1122, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1128, 1135, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1163, 1169, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1185, 1206, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1371, 1388, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1636, 1677, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1679, 1691, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1828, 1840, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1862, 1868, "PROC_ACTION"], [1898, 1917, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1922, 1933, "DEV_NEEDLE"], [1935, 1939, "OBS_ROSE"], [2066, 2074, "PROC_ACTION"], [2136, 2153, "DEV_NEEDLE"], [2159, 2166, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2168, 2173, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2180, 2192, "PROC_METHOD"], [2270, 2286, "PROC_ACTION"], [2350, 2360, "SPECIMEN"], [2376, 2384, "PROC_ACTION"], [2795, 2807, "PROC_ACTION"], [2813, 2819, "PROC_ACTION"], [2824, 2830, "PROC_ACTION"]]}

The upper trachea was normal.\nThe mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the posterior wall causing about 30% airway obstruction.\nThe distal trachea had extensive tumor predominantly involving the right lateral and posterior wall and extending into the carina.\nThe very proximal left mainstem was partially obstructed from tumor infiltration of the main carina.\nBeyond this area the left mainstem, left upper and left lower lobe appeared normal without tumor involvement.\nAt the proximal aspect of the right mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing near complete obstruction (95%).\nTumor extraction was performed using APC and flexible forceps to “burn and shave” the tumor within the trachea and proximal right mainstem.\nOnce we were able to open the right mainstem up to the point that we could inspect the more distal airways we found extensive circumferential tumor infiltration extending to about 5mm distal to the right upper lobe.\nDistally from that point there was no evidence of tumor infiltration. There was extensive tumor within the right upper lobe.\nWe debulked the right mainstem and proximal BI area in a similar fashion.\nWe could not make out tissue plains as the tumor had completely infiltrated the airways.\nWe were able to achieve about 85% opening of the distal tracheal and 50% opening of the right mainstem.\nAt this point due to significant residual disease and fear that further debulking could result in airway perforation given that the airway tissue planes were completely lost from tumor infiltration the decision was made to place a silicone Y-stent for both improved patency and to prevent tumor ingrowth.\nWe also decided to extend stent beyond right upper lobe and “jail” the lobe due to tumor extension from within the right upper lobe which extended into the proximal bronchus intermedius.\nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 80mm in the tracheal limb, 30mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope (required for Y-stent insertion) was inserted through the cords and advanced into the proximal left mainstem and the stent was deployed.\nThrough the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we attempted to seed the stent in place however there was significant difficultly getting the right sided limb past the carinal infiltrative tumor and at one point the stent was noted to tear in the right sided limb.\nWe then removed the stent and inserted another stent of the same size using the same technique.\nAgain it was extremely difficult to get the stent to seed into proper position however after manipulating the stent with rigid forceps and by manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nDue to the prolonged nature of the procedure decision was made to intubate the patient prior to transfer back to the ICU.\nWe then removed the rigid bronchoscope and inserted a 7.0 ETT into the airway over a flexible bronchoscope to allow for visualization of the distal tip and directed the tip of the ETT into the proximal limb of the stent (about 2.5 cm into the stent) inflated the pilot balloon and secured the ETT in place.\nAt this point the procedure was completed and the case was turned over to anesthesia.\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-           Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.", "entities": [[69, 80, "OBS_LESION"], [81, 100, "OBS_LESION"], [116, 123, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [128, 142,

operating room.\nAfter receiving analgesia and paralytics the patient was bag masked and once preoxygenated a 12 mm rigid tracheoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator.\nThe rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.\nAfter inspection bronchoscopy which was unremarkable a BAL was performed in the right middle lobe.\nSubsequentlya Forgery balloon was inserted to the rigid bronchoscope into the anterior segment of the right lower lobe.\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance the cryoprobe was inserted past the balloon into the lateral left lower lobe segment under fluoroscopic guidance.\nOnce the pleural margin was reached the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds at which time the flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were removed en-bloc in the Fogarty balloon was inflated immediately after removal.\nOne specimen was removed from the cryoprobe the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding.\nNo blood was noted and this was repeated for a total of 6 biopsies.\nOnce we were confident that there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed.\nFollowing completion of the procedure fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to evaluate for pneumothorax and

{"id": "note_198", "text": "NOTE_ID:  note_198 SOURCE_FILE: note_198.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: near-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia.\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: near-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia.\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with silicone wire stent placement\nINDICATIONS: tracheal obstruction requiring intervention\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.\nThe patient acknowledged and gave consent. \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.\nInitial airway inspection was performed with the ultra-slim Olympus P190 flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the patient’s customized 5.5 mm tracheostomy tube.\nAt the distal margin of the tracheostomy tube approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina was a ridge of granulation tissue occluding approximately 80% of the tracheostomy tube the lumen.\nBeyond the obstruction there was severe tracheobronchial malacia with near complete obstruction of the distal trachea and right mainstem with approximately 75% obstruction of the left mainstem.\nThe airways were erythematous and inflamed throughout. The flexible bronchoscope and the tracheostomy tube were then removed and we attempted to insert a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope through the small tracheostomy stoma which was unsuccessful.\nWe then reinserted the tracheostomy tube and attempted to insert the rigid bronchoscope through the oral route however the patient had severely distorted upper airway anatomy and edema which made it impossible to visualize the posterior pharynx and vocal cords.\nWe then attempted insertion of progressively smaller rigid bronchoscope down to the smallest diameter of 6 mm without success due to a stricture is within the stoma tract.\nAt this point we called for otolaryngology’s assistance in extending the stoma to allow insertion of the rigid bronchoscope.\nOnce they arrived, they attempted to visualize the vocal cords as well using suspension laryngoscopy but were unsuccessful.\nThey then surgically extended the tracheostomy stoma.  They were unable to extend the stoma to the point where the large rigid bronchoscope could be inserted due to significant scar tissue and concern for injury to the anterior trachea however they were able to extend it to the point we could insert the smaller rigid bronchoscopes.\nAt this point the 6 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma and advanced to the main carina.\nWe however unable to insert any usable instruments or have the ability to deploy the silicone stent through this rigid bronchoscope (due to size) and the decision was made to insert the smallest Y stent available (14 x 10 x 10) through the stoma with rigid forceps compressing the bronchial limbs and advance the stent to the main carina with visualization through a flexible bronchoscope inserted behind  through the left bronchial limb of the stent.\nAfter taking measurements the tracheal limb of the stent was cut to 30mm the left lime cut to 20mm and the right limb cut to 10mm.\nWe were eventually able to successfully advance the stent however the patient’s airways were extremely narrowed and we had significant difficulty seating the bronchial limbs in place properly.\nWe used a variety of techniques including use of the rigid  optical forceps, advancement with Kelly clamps by ENT while we provided direct visualization with the flexible bronchoscope, insertion of CRE balloon to gently push the stent in the place and eventually insertion of the slightly larger  size 8 rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma, into the stent and manipulate the rigid scope to push the limbs into place.\nUnfortunately during this maneuver a small airway tear (likely caused by the distal edge of the stents right bronchial  limb) of the stoma was visualized at the lateral aspect of the right main stem approximately  half a centimeter above the right upper lobe.\nWe consider placing a metallic stent to cover this however were reluctant given the concerns of metallic stents and benign airway disease.\nThe patient was given 1 g of Ancef and we consulted thoracic surgery by phone to discuss options and based on their experience they felt that if there is no evidence of pneumothorax on chest x-ray this type of airway tears often resolves without intervention.\nA portable chest x-ray was then performed which showed no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\nWe are able to slightly advance the stent to see well at the main carina.\nThere was a slight tenting of the distal limb on the right at the distal margin of the airway tear which could not be corrected however otherwise the stent was well seated resulting in resolution of the distal tracheal and mainstem bronchi obstruction and the distal airways were patent.\nWe then reinserted the patient’s tracheostomy tube through the stoma with direct visualization and into the tracheal limb of the stent where it was secured.\nAt this point the procedure was completed and the patient was transferred back to the ICU.\nOnce the patient arrived in the ICU at first he was doing relatively well however he had an episode of inability to ventilate and severe hypoxia with PO2 dropping below 50% transiently while we were still at the bedside.\nThis improved rapidly with manual bag ventilation. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy tube and there did not appear to be any significant obstruction of the stent however there was some foamy bloody airway secretions which were consistent with what would be seen in acute pulmonary edema.\nA chest x-ray was performed during this event (radiology technician was already at the bedside for preplanned chest x-ray) and no pneumothorax was seen.\n20 mg of Lasix were given and the patient’s condom catheter was exchanged for a Foley catheter and there was a rapid diuresis after which his tidal volumes significantly improved.\nPressures required on the ventilator to maintain adequate tidal volumes were relatively high even after this maneuver and was felt  that the patient’s extremely small tracheostomy tube might be contributing to high airway pressures.\nBecause of this we decided to remove the tracheostomy tube and over bronchoscopic visualization insert a 7.0 Boniva tracheostomy tube and secured this in place midway into the stent.\nThis seemed to improve his airway compliance and ventilation.  At this point the patient was deemed stable and after discussing case with parents care was turned over to the ICU team.\nComplications:  small lateral right mainstem airway tear\nRecommendations:\n-\tPatient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight\n-\tCombination vancomycin and Zosyn for 1 week to empirically prevent infection related to airway tear.\n-\tPlease obtain CT chest without contrast once patient has gained stable enough to transport.\n-\tPlan for repeat flexible bronchoscopy at bedside likely on 4/1/2019 or earlier if any concerns arise\n-\tPlease contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient.\n-\tThe patient’s stent is radiolucent and will not be seen on chest x-ray, only CT.\nIf concern for stent related complication occurs flex bronchoscopy should be the first intervention followed by CT of the chest if clinically appropriate to evaluate for complications.\n-\tPatient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.\n-\tIf tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.\n-\tWe will continue to follow.", "entities": [{"span_id": "PROC_ACTION_299", "note_id": "note_198", "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "Rigid bronchoscopy", "start": 299,

The superior segment had tumor infiltration extending into the subsegmental airways.\nThe basilar segments of the RLL were uneffaced.  The LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator.\nThe rigid bronchsocpe was attached to the JET ventilator. Tumor debulking was performed with APC and flexible forceps using the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope and the beveled tip of the rigid bronchoscope.\nUsing a Fogarty balloon we attempted to remove tumor from the right upper lobe , RML and sup segment of RLL but lumens remained obstructed due to extent of disease..  At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 30mm x 10mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire with direct visualization side by side with a ultrathin disposable bronchoscope (Boston Scientific Model B) and the stent was positioned with the proximal end just distal to the RUL.\nThe stent was deployed without difficulty and after minor adjustment  the stent was observed to be well-seated in the bronchus intermedius allowing aeration of the right upper lobe.\nThe non-functional RML and superior segments were occluded to prevent distal tumor ingrowth and preserve the right lower lobe basilar segments.\nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and LMA was reinserted.\nAt this point we prepped the patient for indwelling pleural catheter insertion.\nBedside ultrasound was used to localize an optimal window for tube placement.\nThe site was identified in the right 4th intercostal space latterally.\nThe site was marked, prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.\n1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.\nA 20 gauge Yueh-centesis needle with syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space with aspiration of air / fluid to verify placement.\nThe needle was removed and the catheter left in place.\nA guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter and the catheter was then withdrawn.\nA 1 cm insision was made over the wire and a  separate skin site was identified ~5cm anterior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <0.5 cm incision was then performed.\nA subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.\nThe Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract, followed by dilatation of the pleural access tract with the 16 fr peel away sheath via seldinger technique.\nThe Pleurx catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath.\nBoth incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed.\nThe catheter was subsequently connected to the IPC bottle and 300cc of serous fluid was removed.\nThe catheter tip was then capped and the Pleurx was dressed and covered with a translucent dressing.\nThe patient tolerated the procedural well.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed \nComplications: No immediate complications", "entities": [[73, 84, "OBS_LESION"], [90, 107, "OBS_LESION"], [111, 116, "LATERALITY"], [117, 133, "OBS_LESION"], [163, 181, "OBS_LESION"], [193, 213, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [214, 217, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [222, 225, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [229, 245, "OBS_LESION"], [271, 289, "PROC_METHOD"], [295, 310, "PROC_ACTION"], [315, 319, "DEV_STENT"], [320, 342, "DEV_STENT"], [356, 361, "LATERALITY"], [368, 396, "DEV_CATHETER"], [421, 449, "OBS_LESION"], [1068, 1089, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1104, 1122, "MEDICATION"], [1168, 1191, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1230, 1251, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1272, 1293, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1335, 1342, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1348, 1352, "LATERALITY"], [1353, 1357, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1394, 1415, "OBS_LESION"], [1421, 1435, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1468, 1471, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1472, 1501, "OBS_LESION"], [1531, 1547, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1561, 1576, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1582, 1592, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1628, 1646, "OBS_LESION"], [1669, 1698, "OBS_LESION"], [1730, 1750, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1760, 1785, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1791, 1794, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1817, 1827, "OBS_LESION"], [1833, 1849, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1854, 1872, "OBS_LESION"], [1918, 1934, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1942, 1945, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1967, 1970, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1989, 1994, "MEAS_SIZE"], [1995, 2025, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2093, 2107, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2133, 2147, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2153, 2170, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2191, 2205, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2207, 2222, "PROC_ACTION"], [2242, 2245, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2250, 2266, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2277, 2310, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2338, 2356, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2366, 2381, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2405, 2410, "OBS_LESION"], [2420, 2436, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2439, 2442, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2447, 2458, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2462, 2465, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2486, 2496, "OBS_LESION"], [2596, 2603, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2616, 2637, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2643, 2664, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2684, 2688, "DEV_STENT"], [2689, 2700, "DEV_STENT_SIZE"], [2701, 2745, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [2839, 2872, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2874, 2899, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2909, 2914, "DEV_STENT"], [2971, 2974, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2980, 2985, "DEV_STENT"], [3050, 3055, "DEV_STENT"], [3094, 3114, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3140, 3156, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3177, 3180, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3185, 3202, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3235, 3249, "OBS_LESION"], [3267, 3283, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3284, 3300, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [3371, 3389, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3406, 3409, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3467, 3494, "DEV_CATHETER"], [3506, 3524, "PROC_METHOD"], [3615, 3620, "LATERALITY"], [3621, 3642, "ANAT_PLEURA"], [3721, 3733, "MEDICATION"], [3837, 3845, "DEV_NEEDLE"], [3846, 3866, "DEV_NEEDLE"], [3911, 3924, "ANAT_PLEURA"], [3981, 3987, "DEV_NEEDLE"], [4008, 4016, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4034, 4044, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4067, 4080, "ANAT_PLEURA"], [4093, 4101, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4110, 4118, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4141, 4145, "MEAS_SIZE"], [4173, 4177, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4269, 4278, "MEDICATION"], [4318, 4325, "MEAS_SIZE"], [4447, 4461, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4467, 4482, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4503, 4511, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4615, 4620, "MEAS_PLEURAL_DRAIN"], [4621, 4637, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4667, 4682, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4713, 4719, "MEAS_PLEURAL_DRAIN"], [4720, 4736, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4872, 4882, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [4887, 4892, "MEAS_VOL"], [4926, 4934, "DEV_CATHETER"], [4963, 4969, "DEV_CATHETER"], [5121, 5147, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"]]}

The vocal cords appeared normal.\nThe tracheostomy stoma was mature without granulation tissue. There was no evidence of TE fistula. The tracheal carina was sharp.\nAll right sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental bronchi with findings notable for purulent secretions in the superior segment and basilar segments of the right lower lobe with mild extrinsic compression of the superior segment.\nThe left-sided airways were than inspected. The proximal and mid left mainstem was normal.\nIn the distal aspect of the left mainstem there was an asymmetrical complex-appearing stricture with area of attached granulation tissue, on a stalk, moving in a ball valve motion with breathing resulting in approximately 90% obstruction.\nAt this point the only was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator.\nThere is difficulty ventilating the patient with jet ventilation and oxygen saturation dropped requiring rigid bronchoscope to be removed and LMA replaced until saturation increase.\nWe then reinserted the rigid bronchoscope and had similar problems causing us to convert to closed ventilation with packing of the mouth and nose.\nOnce we are able to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation the FiO2 was decreased until exhaled FiO2 is less than 40% at which time the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and an electrocautery snare was used to remove the area of granulation tissue without difficulty and there is only minimal bleeding.\nSubsequently the electrocautery knife was used to make 2 incisions (2 and 6 o’clock) in the complex-appearing stricture (which is felt to likely be from unrecognized airway trauma at time of injury) after which a phase 8/9/10 Merritt dilatation balloon was used to gently dilate the airway to a maximum diameter of 10 mm.\nAt this point, the rigid bronchoscope was advanced to the distal left mainstem and inserted through the area of the stricture for further mechanical dilatation.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then pulled back to the trachea and on repeat inspection with the flexible bronchoscope the post dilatational orifice was approximately 8 mm with orifice compromised by associated malacia.\nThere remains significant stricturing of the medial wall however decision was made not to further dilate or inserts sent at this time given plan for him to transfer to long-term neuro rehabilitation facility in Northern California in the next few days.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed after which a fresh 6.0 cuffed fenestrated Shiley tracheostomy tube was reinserted through his stoma and attached to the ventilator.\nComplications: None\nRecommendations:\n- Return to ICU for recovery \n- Will discuss case with interventional pulmonology at Stamford prior to the patient’s transfer to Palo Alto neuro rehabilitation facility, as repeat dilatation and possibly temporary stent placement will likely be required.", "entities": [{"id": "ANAT_AIRWAY_28", "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 41}, {"id": "OBS_FINDING_42", "label":

{"id": "note_207", "text": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (head and neck) \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \nMalignant obstruction of Right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left mainstem.\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking (APC and cryodebulking) \nINDICATIONS: multilobar tumor obstruction.\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe trachea was normal with the exception of some small tumor infiltration which was non-obstructive in the left lateral gutter approximately 4cm above the main carina.\nOn the right the mainstem and right upper lobe were normal without endobronchial disease.\nThere was tumor on the posterior wall of the bronchus intermedius causing about 25% obstruction.\nThe right middle lobe was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor.\nThe right lower lobe orifice was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor as well.\nOn the left there was extensive tumor within the mainstem beginning just after the main carina causing about 80-85% obstruction with tumor extending to approximately 2 cm proximal to the LC1 carina.\nWithin the left upper lobe and left lower lobe there is no evidence of endobronchial tumor and the airways were normal.\nAfter inspection the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient was given paralytics by anesthesia after which a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the ventilator.\nInitially biopsies were taken from the distal trachea just proximal to the left mainstem and the right lower lobe and tissue was given to clinical trial team and also collected for pathological review.\nWe began debulking the tumor in the right middle lobe.\nAPC was used to de-vascularize the superficial layer and cryotherapy, forceps were used to slowly debulk the lesion.\nWE were eventually able to open up the airway to where we could see the medial and lateral segments and copious post-obstructive pus was expressed and suctioned with specimen collected for culture.\nTumor continued deep into the subsegmental bronchi and we could only achieve about 40% recanalization.\nWe then moved to right lower lobe and debulked in a similar fashion.\nWe were able to get slightly better recanalization in this lobe but could only achieve approximatly 60% recanalization.\nLike in the middle lobe tumor extended distally into the subsegments.\nThe tumor at in the bronchus intermedius was then debulked with APC using the “burn and shave” technique with complete recanalization.\nWe then moved to the left mainstem and again using a similar technique with APC and forceps were able to achieve about 80% recanalization.\nAPC was used at the end of the procedure to paint and cauterize any active oozing and once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.\nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer patient PACU\n-\tFollow-up PRN if return of

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator.\nFollowing rigid intubation the patient developed unexpected hypoxia of unclear etiology although visible chest rise was seen.\nDecision was made to extubate and then re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope using closed assisted ventilation.\nAfter re-intubating with a similar technique the mouth was packed and the nose was plugged to avoid leak.\nUsing the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed.  Gross pooling of blood was visible throughout the trachea however the trachea itself was normal.\nThe tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.\nOn the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.\nWe’re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion.\nThick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.\nWe then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood.\nWe then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.\nWe then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis.\nThe mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding.\nWe then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.\nAt this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.\nWe then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.\nThe left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.\nWe were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.\nAt this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\nAt completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.\nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.\nFurther documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.\nEtiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia.\n\nComplications:\nPost-operative encephalopathy", "entities": [{"id": "ANAT_AIRWAY_73", "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 86}, {"id": "OBS_LESION_87", "label":

Inspection bronchoscopy was unremarkable.\nSubsequently a Forgery balloon was inserted to the rigid bronchoscope into the superior segment of the lingula.\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance the cryoprobe was inserted past the balloon into the lateral left lower lobe segment under fluoroscopic guidance.\nOnce the pleural margin was reached the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds at which time the flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were removed en-bloc in the Fogarty balloon was inflated immediately after removal.\nOne specimen was removed from the cryoprobe the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding.\nThe patient did develop some minor hemorrhage which resolved after balloon occlusion.\nIt was difficult to maintain the balloon in place and we converted to an endobronchial blocker which was too large to pass the cryoprobe beyond when inserted into the lingua and we subsequently moved the blocker into the mainstem while completing biopsies.\nA total of 6 biopsies were performed. During the procedure the patient developed transient hypoxia requiring us to convert to conventional ventilation and the hypoxia resolved.\nOnce we were confident that there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed.\nFollowing completion of the procedure fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to evaluate for pneumothorax and none was seen.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was subsequently removed once the patient was able to breathe spontaneously.\n-\tPatient to PACU\n-\tCXR pending\n-\tAwait pathological evaluation of tissue", "entities": [[69, 101, "OBS_LESION"], [127, 159, "OBS_LESION"], [182, 200, "PROC_ACTION"], [206, 231, "PROC_ACTION"], [247, 279, "OBS_LESION"], [694, 699, "MEAS_SIZE"], [700, 718, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [741, 752, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [773, 787, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [830, 851, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [877, 895, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [925, 937, "OBS_FINDING"], [954, 969, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [990, 1008, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1018, 1049, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1057, 1078, "PROC_METHOD"], [1083, 1092, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1132, 1163, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1170, 1191, "PROC_METHOD"], [1202, 1216, "ANAT_PLEURA"], [1267, 1271, "MEAS_SIZE"], [1280, 1289, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1308, 1317, "MEAS_TIME"], [1336, 1357, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1362, 1371, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1400, 1415, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1490, 1499, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1504, 1525, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1549, 1556, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1637, 1653, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [1675, 1682, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1767, 1788, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1821, 1830, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1861, 1867, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1898, 1905, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1915, 1923, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1941, 1949, "PROC_ACTION"], [1962, 1963, "MEAS_COUNT"], [1964, 1972, "PROC_ACTION"], [2032, 2049, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2169, 2184, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2189, 2210, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2262, 2285, "PROC_METHOD"], [2293, 2299, "ANAT_PLEURA"], [2330, 2342, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2366, 2384, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"]]}

The carina was sharp.\nThe right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal.\nNo evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.\nThe proximal left mainstem was normal The left upper lobe was essentially completely closed due to what appeared to be scan and granulation tissue while the left lower lobe was approximately 80% obstructed due to mostly anatomical distortion as well as some degree related to granulation tissue.\nWe could not bypass the obstruction with the diagnostic bronchoscope.\nThe video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe EBUS bronchoscope was first used to inspect the level of the 10L lymph node due to radiographic suspicion for disease.\nNo evidence of adenopathy was seen. We then evaluated the sation 7 lymph node due to radiographic concerns.\nSampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle for a total of 4 passes.\nROSE did not show evidence suspicious for malignancy. The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator.\nThe rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.\nWe then inserted therapeutic T190 flexible bronchoscope into the airway and advanced to the left upper lobe orifice.\nWe attempted to gently dilate the orifice using a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion but were unable to clearly define branching segments and aborted we then dilated the orifice of the left lower lobe starting with a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion before converting to an 8.9.10 balloon also dilating with a similar technique.\nThe orifice post dilatation was approximately 70% open. We then were able to advance the therapeutic bronchoscope into the left lower lobe.\nSegmental stricturing was seen in the superior segment and the medial basal segment if the left lower lobe.\nGentile dilatation was performed within the segments resulting in significant improvement in diameter.\nOnce this was completed, we inspected the airway for evidence of bleeding and none was seen.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted while awaiting emergence and the procedure was completed.\nComplications: None\nRecommendations: \n- Transfer to PACU then home once criteria are met.\n- Wil follow-up in pulm clinic for re-evaluation and repeat CT in 1 week.", "entities": [{"start": 24, "end": 39, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "Airway Stenosis"}, {"start": 97, "end": 112, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "Airway Stenosis"}, {"start": 178, "end": 196, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "Rigid bronchoscopy"}, {"start": 202, "end": 220, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "Balloon dilatation"}, {"start": 247, "end": 251, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "EBUS"}, {"start": 257, "end": 261, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "TBNA"}, {"start": 277, "end": 292, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "Airway Stenosis"}, {"start": 472, "end": 475, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "LMA"}, {"start": 497, "end": 518, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "flexible bronchoscope"}, {"start": 567, "end": 574, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "text": "trachea"}, {"start": 580, "end": 587, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "text": "trachea"}, {"start": 615, "end": 621, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "text": "carina"}, {"start": 637, "end": 670, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "text": "right sided tracheobronchial tree"}, {"start": 855, "end": 877, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "text": "proximal left mainstem"}, {"start": 893, "end": 908, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "left upper lobe"}, {"start": 979, "end": 997, "label": "OBS_FINDING", "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1023, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "left lower lobe"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1056, "label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE", "text": "approximately 80% obstructed"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1145, "label": "OBS_FINDING", "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1302, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1289, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "EBUS"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1414, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "EBUS"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1474, "label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "text": "10L"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1595, "label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "text": "sation 7"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1681, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "transbronchial needle aspiration"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1717, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "EBUS"}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1721, "label": "PROC_ACTION", "text": "TBNA"}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1730, "label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "text": "22 gauge"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1761, "label": "MEAS_COUNT", "text": "4 passes"}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1825, "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "EBUS"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1863, "label": "MEAS_SIZE", "text": "11 mm"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1894, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "rigid bronchoscope"}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1928, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "text": "trachea"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2023, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "flexible bronchoscope"}, {"start": 2049, "end": 2067, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "rigid bronchoscope"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2124, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "T190 flexible bronchoscope"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2124, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "flexible bronchoscope"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2176, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "left upper lobe"}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2253, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "6-7-8 CRE balloon"}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2391, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "left lower lobe"}, {"start": 2408, "end": 2425, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "6-7-8 CRE balloon"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2486, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "8.9.10 balloon"}, {"start": 2559, "end": 2581, "label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST", "text": "approximately 70% open"}, {"start": 2650, "end": 2665, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "left lower lobe"}, {"start": 2705, "end": 2721, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "superior segment"}, {"start": 2730, "end": 2750, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "medial basal segment"}, {"start": 2758, "end": 2773, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "left lower lobe"}, {"start": 2975, "end": 2993, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "rigid bronchoscope"}, {"start": 3013, "end": 3016, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "text": "LMA"}]}

The vocal fold on the left was slightly edematous but the cords appeared normal.\nThe subglottic space was normal.  The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp.\nThe tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level.\nThere was significant distortion of the right sided airways with approximately 60% obstruction from external compression (seen on CT and known to be due to “pinching” from the spine and pulmonary artery).\nRight sided bronchial mucosa was otherwise normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.\nNo evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.\nOn the left the proximal mainstem appeared normal.

There was direct tumor invasion of the N1 lymph node (11L) and it was not specifically sampled.\nROSE did not show clear evidence of malignancy of nodal sampling.\nWe then used the EBUS scope to visualize the 4cm mass adjacent to the left mainstem bronchi and were able to access it with the EBUS TBNA needle.\nPreliminary ROSE was consistent with malignancy.

hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.\n- If invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\n- Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.",

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed.\nA time-out was performed before the intervention.\n\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room.\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation.\nTopical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.\nThe proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM).\nThe right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction.\nA few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane.\nThe proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall.\nIn the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent.\nAfter gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout.\n10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared.\nSignificant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture.\nAfter suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall.\nThe left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease.\n\nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator.\nThe rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent.\nAPC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue.\nWe then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa.\nAfter this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall.\nWe repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway.\nWe then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent.\nAPC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris.\nSignificant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present.\nAt this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success;\nhowever, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius.\nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement.\nWe customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb.\nWe also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed.\nAfter deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\nPersistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was removed, and an LMA was inserted, and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care.\nRecommendations:\n\n•\tTransfer to PACU\n•\tObtain post-procedure chest x-ray.\n•\tPatient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation, given residual disease.\n•\tPatient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucus impaction and obstruction of stent.\n•\tManagement of stent-related complications was discussed with the in-patient team, and a notice for airway management precautions was placed above the patient's bed.\n•\tPlan to schedule the procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after the effects of radiation should be seen).", "entities": [{"span_id": "OBS_LESION_70", "note_id": "note_219", "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "Small Cell Lung

{"id": "note_220", "text": "Procedure Name: Inspection bronchoscopy with bronchial lavage\nIndications: Right lower lobe collapse and possible BP fistula\nMedications: General Anesthesia\nProcedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient.\nAll questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol.\nA history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record.\nLaboratory studies and radiographs \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.\nThe trachea was of normal caliber.

Once it was confirmed that there was no active bleeding, the flexible bronchoscope was removed.\nFollowing the completion of the procedure, fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to assess for pneumothorax, and a moderate right-sided pneumothorax was visualized.\nThe right lateral chest wall was marked, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.\nA 20-gauge Yueh-centesis needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space under fluoroscopic visualization, with aspiration of air to verify placement.\nThe needle was then removed, and the catheter was left in place.\nA guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter, and the catheter was then withdrawn.\nA 0.5cm incision was made through the skin, and the subcutaneous tissues were dilated.\nThe 14Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain was inserted into the pleural space. The drain was immediately connected to a Pleur-evac.\nAdequate placement was confirmed by air leak and fluoroscopy. The tube was sutured in place, and a dressing was applied.\nAt this point, the endotracheal tube was removed, and the procedure was completed.\nEstimated Blood Loss: 10cc\nComplications: Pneumothorax

The trachea and right sided airways were otherwise normal.\nThe left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of obstruction in the proximal and mid portions.\nThere was a small area of abnormal mucosal thickening in the proximal posterior wall which we attempted to biopsy with forceps but specimen was lost during forceps extraction.\nAt the distal le mainstem there was complete obstruction secondary to circumferential fibrinous scar.\nWe were able to identify a pin-hole using the thin bronchoscope but could not view distally of bypass with the scope.\nA Fogarty balloon was then passed through the hole and inflated and then retracted through the stenosis to gently dilate the airway.\nPurulent material was visualized and collected via trap. This was repeated multiple times with varying sized of Fogarty balloons.\nThe electrocautery knife was then used to make linear incisions within the scar after which serial proximal dilatations were performed with the 6,7,8 Merit phased dilatational balloon.\nContinued purulent return indicated intraluminal dilatation. We were eventually able to pass the central obstruction with the therapeutic bronchoscope but distal visualization was limited.\nWith the P190X thin bronchoscope we were able to visualize free wires from previous left upper lobe resection and stenotic distal airways with associated bronchomalacia and adherent white waxy fibrinous tissue.\nWhile one airway was clearly visualized with distal carinas seen, the anatomy was extremely distorted and the extensive fibrinous material/inflammation made it impossible to confidently confirm that the other associated orifices e were not in a false lumen.\nAt this point we obtained forceps biopsies from the abnormal tissue and the case was completed with plan to reassess after repeat CT.\nRecommendations:\n-\tCXR in PACU\n-\tTransfer patient to ward\n-\tRepeat CT today", "entities": [{"span_id": "PROC_METHOD_21", "note_id": "note_223", "label": "PROC_METHOD", "text": "flexible bronchoscopy", "start": 21, "end": 42}, {"span_id":

At the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.\nThe left lower lobe was completely obstructed with tumor. Forceps biopsy was performed of the visible endobronchial tumor and samples were placed in formalin.\nNext the Corecath electrocautery suction device was used to dubulk the tumor followed by cryotherapy for removal of retained tumor.\nWe were able to achieve approximately 80% luminal re-cannulation. Mild tumor infiltration was present in the airway wall until just proximal to the takeoff of the anterior-medial segment of the left lower lobe and distal to that the airways were un-effected.\nGiven that the patient has had tumor progression despite chemotherapy we felt that airway stent placement was warranted to preserve the lower lobe and prevent regrowth of tumor (barrier effect) with the understanding that this would “jail” the superior segment of the lower lobe and we would essentially sacrifice one segment to preserve the rest of the lobe.\nAt this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed bronchus intermedius with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and a Ultraflex 30mm x 10mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed however slightly too proximal and subsequently was removed using forceps.\nThe jagwire was re-inserted and using a similar technique an Aero 30mm x 12mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed without difficulty and the flexible bronchoscope was then re-inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the stent was observed to be well-seated in the left lower lobe and distal mainstem with the distal tip just proximal to the basilar segments of the lower lobe.\nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.\nA few minutes later while anesthesia was bagging the patient as she emerged she became difficult to ventilate and hypoxic.\nAn LMA was inserted but she could still not ventilate and anesthesia then inserted an endotracheal tube after which ventilation was restored and hypoxia resolved.\nIt was felt this episode was caused by acute laryngospasm.\nWe then inserted a flexible bronchoscope through the ETT to inspect the airways and reposition the tube proximal to the carina (was right mainstem intubated. The stent appeared in-place without issues.

The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of stent obstruction.\nAt the distal edge of the stent there was some minor granulation tissue which was nonobstructive.\nDistal to the stent there was complete obstruction of the left lower lobe orifice secondary to granulation tissue.\nUsing the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract granulation tissue to visualize the segmental stenosis in the left lower lobe.\nAll of the segments were obstructed with granulation tissue as well which we also removed with cryotherapy as well as flexible forceps.\nAt this point we decided to remove the left mainstem stent for a few reasons.\nThe first is that pathology from previous bronchoscopy at time of stent placement did not show evidence of tumor and metallic stents are not advised for benign disease.\nThe second was that her new obstruction was secondary to distal granulation tissue and it was unclear whether the stent was providing any current benefit.\nFinally, our hope was that the short-term placement of the stent allowed some remodeling of the airway to relieve the previous obstruction.\nAt this point the LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway.\nUsing flexible forceps to grasp the proximal string on the stent we were able to gently retract the stent and remove it without difficulty.\nSubsequently they flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and as we had hoped the orifice had remodeled and essentially there is no obstruction at the level of the previous stent.\nAt the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.\nThen, using a 8–9–10 millimeter CRE balloon dilated each of the left lower lobe subsegments as well as the left lower lobe main bronchus which improved patency of the subsegments to approximately 50% of normal and left lower lobe bronchus to approximately 80%.\nCryotherapy was then performed with 30 second freeze/thaw cycles to induce tissue sloughing.\nFinally using the super dimension 21-gauge needle we injected a total of 5 mL of Kenalog 10 mg/milliliter solution into the submucosa have areas of significant granulation tissue in hopes of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect to prevent regrowth of granulation tissue.\nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.\nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer patient back to the ICU\n-\tPost-procedure x-ray\n-\tPatient to follow-up with me for repeat bronchoscopy in about a week to remove debris post cryotherapy as well as to assess for evidence of restenosis.", "entities": [[24, 37, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [38, 43, "DEV_STENT"], [44,

The upper trachea was normal.\nThe mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction.\nThe distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well.\nThe distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.\nIt appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression.\nTumor debulking  was performed using APC to  “burn and shave” the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent.\nThe right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina.\nThere was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.\nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position.\nPost-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent.\nWe then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.", "entities": [[69, 78, "OBS_ROSE"], [164, 172, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [173, 180, "DEV_STENT"], [202, 220, "PROC_ACTION"], [226, 241, "PROC_ACTION"], [246, 254, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [272, 280, "DEV_STENT"], [305, 323, "OBS_LESION"], [691, 695, "MEAS_SIZE"], [696, 726, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [708, 726, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [915, 920, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [945, 949, "MEAS_SIZE"], [950, 980, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1009, 1020, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1030, 1041, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1256, 1294, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1300, 1313, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1330, 1341, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1346, 1359, "OBS_LESION"], [1374, 1392, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1407, 1429, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1435, 1449, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1464, 1469, "OBS_LESION"], [1485, 1493, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1499, 1506, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1507, 1525, "OBS_LESION"], [1539, 1553, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1564, 1575, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1599, 1618, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1627, 1641, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1646, 1656, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1675, 1699, "OBS_LESION"], [1764, 1779, "PROC_ACTION"], [1801, 1804, "PROC_METHOD"], [1830, 1835, "OBS_LESION"], [1847, 1854, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1878, 1886, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1898, 1909, "PROC_ACTION"], [1990, 1995, "OBS_LESION"], [2000, 2013, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2014, 2019, "OBS_LESION"], [2040, 2043, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2053, 2064, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2073, 2093, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2098, 2116, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2151, 2165, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2198, 2206, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2216, 2227, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2255, 2273, "OBS_LESION"], [2306, 2322, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2331, 2350, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2422, 2430, "DEV_STENT_SIZE"], [2431, 2439, "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL"], [2440, 2447, "DEV_STENT"], [2463, 2467, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2475, 2488, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2490, 2497, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2505, 2524, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2529, 2533, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2541, 2559, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2565, 2583, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2608, 2613, "DEV_STENT"], [2666, 2680, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2694, 2700, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2719, 2728, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2762, 2767, "DEV_STENT"], [2780, 2791, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2801, 2808, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2814, 2832, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2874, 2887, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2926, 2947, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2984, 2989, "DEV_STENT"], [3031, 3038, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3040, 3054, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3059, 3072, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3091, 3101, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST"], [3123, 3141, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3289, 3303, "MEDICATION"], [3326, 3331, "DEV_STENT"], [3443, 3452, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3475, 3497, "MEDICATION"], [3668, 3682, "DEV_STENT"], [3768, 3771, "MEAS_SIZE"], [3783, 3786, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3851, 3868, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3874, 3891, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3925, 3929, "MEAS_SIZE"], [3939, 3952, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [3960, 3965, "DEV_STENT"]]}

Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted.\nTopical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.\nThe laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous.\nGranulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube.\nThe T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion.\nBy applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube.\nThich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps.\nTo improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear.\nThe distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal;\nthere are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps.\nThe bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube.\nUsing gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place.\nAt this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma.\nThe dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway.\nThe guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place.\nThe bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.\nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue.\nWe were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time.\nThe bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure competed. \n\n. Approximately 4 cm below the vocal cords the previously placed silicone tube stent was visualized.\nThere was mild granulation tissue at the proximal end which was non-obstructive.\nThe stent was widely patent and clear of debris. .\nAt this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea.\nDual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope.\nThe stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen.\nAn LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space.\nThe exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated.\nThe mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent.\nThe A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm.\nAt this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.\nThe excised 15x50mm silicone stent was cleaned and loaded into the Efer-dumon stent loading system and deployed through the rigid bronchoscope into the previous location without difficulty.\nThe stent was well seated with the proximal limb approximately XXX cm distal to the vocal cords and the airway was 100% patent.\nThe bronchoscope was subsequently removed, and the

The stent was well positioned and partially compressed externally.\nA 14/16.5/18 mm Elation dilatational balloon was used to dilate the stent after which the airway was approximately 90% of normal caliber.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation(CPT 31641)\nINDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.\nAfter administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx.\nWe then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. The subglottic area and proximal trachea were normal.\nAt the level of the med trachea there was a large polypoid tumor with a ball valve effect with the base at the left posterior tracheal wall.\nThe tumor was about 90% obstructive of the normal tracheal diameter.\nAdditionally there wer multiple small polypoid lesions surrounding the large obstructive mass mostly on the posterior wall of the trachea but also on the anterior and right tracheal wall.\nThese findings extended for about 3cm. We did not attempt to pass the polypoid lesion with the bronchoscope during the initial inspection.\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator.\nThe T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the obstructive mass at its base.\nWe then inserted the 1.9mm cryotherapy probe through the flexible bronchoscope and attached the probe using cryotherapy to the resected tumor and attempted to extract it through the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe tumor however was too large and repeatedly fell off of the cryoprobe when trying to pull it through the rigid scope.\nWe then switched to the large 2.4mm cryoprobe and again using the same technique were able to pull pieces of the tumor out if a piecemeal fashion and residual pieces of the resected tumor were then extracted with flexible forceps.\nAfter the primary tumor was removed we then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization.\nAt the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 95% open in comparison to unaffected areas.\nWe then were able to complete the distal airway inspection.\nThe lower trachea, right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.\nRecommendations:\n·           Transfer patient back to ICU \n·           Obtain post procedure CXR\n·           Await final pathology results", "entities": [{"start": 69,

Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation(CPT 31641)\nINDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.\nAfter administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx.\nWe then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.\nAdditionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina.\nThe right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator.\nThe T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment.\nAfter these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion.\nWe then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization.\nAt the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.\nOf note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago.\nI suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\nRecommendations: \n•\tTransfer patient back to ward room \n•\tAwait final pathology results  \n•\tWill need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.", "entities": [[69, 81, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [82, 87, "OBS_LESION"], [115, 127, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [128, 133, "OBS_LESION"], [134, 137, "CTX_HISTORICAL"], [138, 147, "PROC_ACTION"], [182, 200, "PROC_ACTION"], [206, 217, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [218, 223, "OBS_LESION"], [224, 232, "PROC_ACTION"], [257, 265, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [266, 277, "OBS_FINDING"], [290, 308, "MEDICATION"], [444, 465, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [491, 494, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [508, 515, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [538, 550, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [560, 576, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [592, 598, "MEAS_SIZE"], [613, 624, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [636, 637, "MEAS_COUNT"], [638, 654, "OBS_LESION"], [673, 705, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [795, 810, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [865, 873, "OBS_LESION"], [875, 879, "MEAS_COUNT"], [881, 888, "OBS_LESION"], [964, 980, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [982, 999, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1001, 1016, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1041, 1044, "MEAS_SIZE"], [1061, 1072, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1078, 1089, "LATERALITY"], [1094, 1104, "LATERALITY"], [1105, 1112, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1184, 1203, "OBS_LESION"], [1207, 1228, "OBS_FINDING"], [1234, 1255, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1260, 1263, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1283, 1287, "MEAS_SIZE"], [1288, 1322, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1358, 1374, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1396, 1401, "OBS_LESION"], [1435, 1469, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1502, 1520, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1529, 1549, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1562, 1570, "PROC_ACTION"], [1575, 1597, "OBS_LESION"], [1617, 1618, "MEAS_COUNT"], [1640, 1647, "OBS_LESION"], [1656, 1663, "OBS_LESION"], [1700, 1707, "PROC_ACTION"], [1792, 1799, "OBS_LESION"], [1805, 1812, "PROC_ACTION"], [1819, 1821, "MEAS_COUNT"], [1828, 1835, "OBS_LESION"], [1843, 1849, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1886, 1891, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1897, 1904, "PROC_ACTION"], [1939, 1942, "PROC_METHOD"], [1946, 1961, "PROC_ACTION"], [1976, 1981, "OBS_LESION"], [1994, 2029, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2016, 2023, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2166, 2174, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST"], [2214, 2232, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2242, 2249, "PROC_ACTION"], [2335, 2347, "DEV_STENT"], [2386, 2393, "OBS_LESION"], [2415, 2425, "CTX_TIME"], [2446, 2469, "PROC_ACTION"], [2579, 2584, "DEV_STENT"], [2634, 2639, "DEV_STENT"], [2676, 2688, "MEDICATION"], [2723, 2730, "OBS_LESION"], [2838, 2844, "PROC_ACTION"], [2895, 2917, "DEV_STENT"], [3098, 3101, "PROC_METHOD"], [3105, 3118, "PROC_METHOD"]]}

The tumor was mostly confined to the posterior and left lateral wall. At the distal aspect of the tumor (3cm proximal to the main carina there was an obvious fistulous communication with the esophagus in the left recess between the posterior and lateral tracheal wall.  The distal 3 cm of the trachea appeared normal. There was purulent material in the left mainstem which was suctioned and all airways beyond the trachea appeared normal without evidence of mucosal irregularities of endobronchial disease. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were \nremoved and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea and with bronchoscopic observation placed a 16x60 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent. The stent deployed more distally than expected with the distal edge within the right mainstem and the proximal edge not fully covering the obstruction.\nWe were able to pull the stent proximally but slightly more proximal than expected to cover the upper tracheal obstruction but the distal margin and TE fistula remained exposed.\nAt this point our thought was that the obstruction was covered and that GI would place a stent to cover the fistula.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was removed and GI then attempted through EGD to place the stent but were unable to bypass the esophageal obstruction.\nWe then re-intubated with the tracheoscope and using a similar technique to before and using forceps biopsied the exposed tumor.\nWe then placed a second 16X60 aero SEM into the distal trachea telescoping into the more proximal stent.\nThis resulted in complete occlusion of the fistula and complete opening of the trachea to a normal diameter.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nOnce the patient was felt to be able to adequately protect airway the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nMixed infiltrative tumor of the trachea and TE fistula s/p tracheal stenting with complete recanalization and obstruction of fistula \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await tissue diagnosis\n- Obtain post procedure CXR- TID saline nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent", "entities": [{"span_id": "OBS_LESION_69", "note_id":

We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps.\nThe proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent.\nBoth stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass.\nThe patient’s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula.\nThe airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\n-\tStent infection\n-\tStent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.\n-\tPersistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent \n-\ts/p airway stent removal\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await cultures\n- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula\n- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.", "entities": [{"id": "OBS_LESION_69", "label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 69, "end":

The patient was placed right side down to protect the left lung and while suctioning blood via a flexible bronchoscope in the ETT.\nVision remained poor and we utilized topical TXA and epi to try to slow the bleeding while using cryotherapy probe to pull blood clots from the airways.\nEventually the bleeding stopped and the patient’s oxygen saturation returned to normal.\nOnce we were able to better visualize the airways we found that the left side had relatively mild blood spillover and at the LC1 carina the transected tumor was seen which was removed piecemeal using the cryotherapy probe.\nSubsequently we began to debulk further into right lung. The right upper lobe was eventually visualized.\nWe attempted to use APC to \"burn and shave\" residual airway tumor however patient would quickly desat with drops in FIO2 required to safely use thermal therapies.\nWe were able to debulk until what was likely the distal aspect of the BI but significant tumor still remained.\nPatient had extremely low reserve and since he continued to desaturate limiting our ability to continue debulk we decided to APC the base or the tumor as well as the residual tumor in the airway wall until we were confident that there was no active bleeding and abort attempts to further debulk for now and to consider returning to the OR at a later date.\nOnce this was accomplished the ETT position was confirmed to be 3cm above the carina.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and there procedure completed. Decision in consultation with anesthesia was for patient to remain intubated for now and transfer to the ICU.\nSpecimens: Right mainstem tumor\nFluids/Blood Products:\nIVF: 1500  EBL: 200cc  Blood Products: None\n Complications: Severe hemorrhage, severe hypoxia, Escalation in level of care.\nRecommendations: \n-\tPatient to remain intubated overnight, with endobronchial blocker at bedside.\n-\tIf no bleeding overnight plan to extubate tomorrow.\n-\tWill need to discuss options moving forward. Given the extent of the tumor risk/benefit ratio of re-attempting debulking needs to be carefully considered along with alternative options such as radiotherapy.", "entities": [[36, 50, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [76, 88, "OBS_LESION"], [115, 120, "OBS_LESION"], [140, 160, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [183, 201, "PROC_ACTION"], [207, 230, "PROC_ACTION"], [244, 249, "OBS_LESION"], [265, 279, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [697, 702, "MEAS_SIZE"], [715, 733, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [756, 767, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [760, 767, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [841, 862, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [888, 906, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [948, 955, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [957, 966, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1048, 1062, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1093, 1112, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1119, 1129, "OBS_LESION"], [1164, 1170, "OBS_LESION"], [1230, 1245, "OBS_LESION"], [1239, 1245, "OBS_LESION"], [1256, 1276, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1282, 1288, "OBS_LESION"], [1380, 1398, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1421, 1435, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1569, 1580, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1595, 1598, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1637, 1640, "MEAS_SIZE"], [1641, 1644, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1700, 1709, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1743, 1764, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1772, 1775, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1822, 1825, "MEDICATION"], [1830, 1833, "MEDICATION"], [1874, 1891, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2143, 2153, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2169, 2174, "OBS_LESION"], [2222, 2239, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2266, 2272, "PROC_ACTION"], [2286, 2296, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2366, 2369, "PROC_METHOD"], [2406, 2411, "OBS_LESION"], [2525, 2531, "PROC_ACTION"], [2579, 2581, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2598, 2603, "OBS_LESION"], [2724, 2730, "PROC_ACTION"], [2745, 2748, "PROC_METHOD"], [2765, 2770, "OBS_LESION"], [2795, 2800, "OBS_LESION"], [2908, 2914, "PROC_ACTION"], [3007, 3010, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3243, 3263, "OBS_LESION"], [3258, 3263, "OBS_LESION"], [3292, 3296, "MEAS_VOL"], [3303, 3308, "MEAS_VOL"], [3347, 3364, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [3366, 3380, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [3475, 3496, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [3634, 3639, "OBS_LESION"], [3676, 3682, "PROC_ACTION"]]}

The subglottic space was normal.\nThe trachea was normal appearing with minimal mild thick secretions.\nThe bronchoscope was then advanced to the main carina, which was sharp.\nThe bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Each segment and subsegment within the right upper, right middle, right lower lobe was well visualized.\nThe right sided airway anatomy was normal and no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right.\nThe bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the left main stem.\nIn the distal mainstem there was circumferential erythema of the airway wall without stenosis.\nThere was purulent secretions in the left upper and lower lobe.\nBronchial wash was performed in the left upper lobe for culture.\nThe left upper lobe airways were not stenotic but had chronic erythematous appearance consistent with radiation changes.\nThe left lower lobe take-off was not stenotic but there was moderate stenosis of the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe and severe stenosis (90%) of the anterior medial segment.\nNo specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the left.\nFollowing inspection we removed the diagnostic bronchoscope and introduced the T180 therapeutic bronchoscope.\nOur attention to the stenosis within the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe and gentle dilatation was performed with the 6mm Elation dilating balloon with mild improvement in stenosis.\nThe airway wall was friable however and oozed easily. We then attempted to gently dilate the anterior-medial segment by bypassing the obstruction and gently inflating the balloon to partial expansion (<6mm) and pull back through the stenosis.\nWhen this was done relatively brisk bleeding developed. We then wedged the bronchoscope in the left lower lobe for 2 minutes and reassessed.\nAt that point the bleeding had stopped and we felt that given the distal airway disease (likely radiation induced) and only segmental obstruction, the risk/benefit ratio of continued attempts at dilatation favored abstaining from further intervention.\nAt this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\nRecommendations:\n- Patient to PACU for recovery\n- Await culture results\n- Follow-up with primary pulmonologist", "entities": [[24, 33, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [34, 42, "OBS_FINDING"], [86, 95, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [96, 104, "OBS_FINDING"], [126, 147, "PROC_METHOD"], [148, 166, "PROC_ACTION"], [181, 196, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [197, 205, "OBS_FINDING"], [219, 228, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [229, 240, "OBS_FINDING"], [461, 479, "PROC_METHOD"], [560, 569, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [589, 621, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [744, 751, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [756, 762, "OBS_FINDING"], [778, 807, "OBS_FINDING"], [813, 825, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [851, 862, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [885, 897, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [925, 939, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [980, 991, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [993, 1005, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1007, 1023, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1080, 1086, "OBS_FINDING"], [1103, 1109, "OBS_LESION"], [1119, 1126, "OBS_LESION"], [1158, 1179, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1198, 1210, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [1239, 1246, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1274, 1288, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1297, 1312, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1323, 1347, "OBS_FINDING"], [1355, 1366, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1375, 1383, "OBS_FINDING"], [1395, 1414, "OBS_FINDING"], [1422, 1432, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1437, 1447, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1449, 1463, "PROC_ACTION"], [1485, 1500, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1518, 1533, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1551, 1559, "OBS_FINDING"], [1576, 1599, "OBS_FINDING"], [1616, 1633, "OBS_FINDING"], [1639, 1663, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1672, 1680, "OBS_FINDING"], [1704, 1712, "OBS_FINDING"], [1720, 1743, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1751, 1761, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1773, 1781, "OBS_FINDING"], [1783, 1786, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE"], [1795, 1818, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [1832, 1838, "OBS_LESION"], [1848, 1855, "OBS_LESION"], [1887, 1908, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [1958, 1981, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2001, 2030, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2053, 2061, "OBS_FINDING"], [2073, 2096, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2104, 2119, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2131, 2141, "PROC_ACTION"], [2165, 2193, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2199, 2215, "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST"], [2219, 2227, "OBS_FINDING"], [2233, 2244, "ANAT_AIRWAY"], [2249, 2256, "OBS_FINDING"], [2269, 2281, "OBS_FINDING"], [2311, 2317, "PROC_ACTION"], [2322, 2345, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2363, 2374, "OBS_FINDING"], [2386, 2395, "PROC_ACTION"], [2400, 2407, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2430, 2434, "MEAS_SIZE"], [2440, 2449, "PROC_ACTION"], [2462, 2470, "OBS_FINDING"], [2502, 2526, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2547, 2559, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"], [2567, 2582, "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"], [2587, 2596, "MEAS_TIME"], [2631, 2651, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2737, 2758, "OBS_FINDING"], [2808, 2818, "PROC_ACTION"], [2917, 2935, "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"], [2940, 2952, "DEV_INSTRUMENT"]]}

The patients known tracheal 12X20 Bonostent was visualized with the proximal edge abutting the distal aspect of the true vocal folds.\nThere was significant thick dry mucous with mild obstruction however the stent was otherwise patent.\nJust distal to the stent was a 4cm long complex tracheal stenosis with circumferential friable and edematous mucosa.\nAn “A-shaped” deformity was visualized within the segment consistent with tracheal cartilage injury along with overlying granulation tissue creating a slit light obstruction of approximately 80% of the normal tracheal lumen.\nThe mid to distal trachea was normal and full inspection of the distal tracheobronchial tree revealed no other abnormalities and all bronchial segments were widely patent to at least the 1st sub-segmental branch.\nThe laryngeal mask airway was removed and a a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supra-glottic space.\nRigid alligator forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe stent was subsequently removed without difficulty.  The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced through the vocal cords into the subglottic space and attached the jet ventilator.\nBalloon dilatation of the stenotic segment was performed with a phased 8-9-10 Merit dilatational balloon.\nDue to the deformity and lack of cartilaginous structure this only provided mild additional benefit.\nThe 10 mm rigid bronchosocpe was then telescoped into the tracheoscope and approximated to the level of the most significant stenosis.\nThe beveled tip was used to gently debulk granulation tissue with an apple coring technique.\nAt this point a 12 X 40 bonostent was placed under direct visualization with the proximal edge at the level of the cricoid cartilage about 2 cm distal to the true vocal folds and the distal edge 1 cm beyond the distal stenotic segment.\nBalloon dilatation of stent was performed using a phased 12-13.5-15 Merit dilatational balloon.\nFollowing dilatation the trachea was widely patent with a luminal diameter approximately 95% of the normal.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed and the LMA re-inserted.\nFinal inspection of the airway was performed and images captures after which the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.

{"id": "note_258", "text": "NOTE_ID:  note_258 SOURCE_FILE: note_258.txt PROCEDURE TECHNIQUE: Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions, there was extrinsic compression noted in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which precluded deeper visual inspection of suspected endobronchial disease within the segment. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11L lymph node. Further details regarding nodal size are in the table below. The EBUS scope was positioned in the origin of the left lower lobe and turned posteriorly to visualize the lung mass abutting the airway which measured 31.5mm in short axis diameter. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. We then reintroduced the EBUS scope into the left lower lobe and visualized the mass abutting the airway and EBUS guided sampling was performed of the mass with the EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation yielded tissue concerning for malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology and additional needle passes were performed for molecular studies.

There was tumor infiltration within the distal trachea just proximal to the main carina on the right lateral wall with slowly oozing blood visualized.\nThat main carina was involved on the right side. The left sided aiways were normal.\nThe proximal right mainstem was completely obstructed with friable enbdobronchial tumor APC was used to burn and shave the tumor and flexible forceps were used for biopsy.\nAs we slowly debulked the tumor it became clear that the involvement was extensive.\nUsing the P90 slim bronchoscope we were able to bypass tumor using saline aliquots to stent the airway open and eventually could visualize the basilar segments of the lower lobe where persistent tumor was seen.\nUsing a forgery balloon and the pullback method we were able to dilate the airway slightly and then using an 8,9,10 CRE balloon gently dilated the BI and RLL bronchus.\nWhile bleeding was encountered it was not brisk and was controlled with tropical TXA, epi and cold saline.\nWhile considering stent placement the patient’s blood pressure began to slowly drop despite increasing vasopressor requirement and patient went into PEA/Asystole.\nCode blue was called and CRP initiated. A left sided chest tube was placed and there was no gush of air concerning for PTX.\nUltrasound showed no cardiac motion and no evidence of pericardial effusion.\nPatient received multiple doses of epinephrine and chest compressions but remained in non-shockable rhythm (asystole).\nDecision was made to attempt TPA given that all other H’s and T’s were considered and not apparent.\nThis did not have any effect. While we were confident that a right sided PTX was not present (lung completely obstructed by tumor and atelectatic) A right sided chest tube was placed to attempt to offload pressure from known pleural effusion again without response.\nAt hat 15:10 after approximately 30 minutes of CPR the patient was declared dead.\nFamily was notified and handled information appropriately. Medical examiner was contacted and declined case.\nComplications:  Intra-operative death (direct cause unclear)", "entities": [{"start": 24, "end": 60, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 92, "end": 112, "label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"}, {"start": 136, "end": 148, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 223, "end": 231, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 235, "end": 240, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 253, "end": 265, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 271, "end": 293, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 304, "end": 316, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 391, "end": 418, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 422, "end": 438, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 461, "end": 481, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 503, "end": 523, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 558, "end": 576, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 582, "end": 605, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 610, "end": 628, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 643, "end": 657, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 658, "end": 683, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1073, "label": "MEAS_SIZE"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1104, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1159, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1182, "end": 1196, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1240, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1283, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1328, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1394, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1423, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1462, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1495, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1521, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1575, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1629, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1647, "end": 1670, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1730, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1734, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1751, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1761, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1771, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1792, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1813, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1836, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1846, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1930, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1959, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2058, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"}, {"start": 2066, "end": 2076, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2099, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2133, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 2174, "end": 2180, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 2219, "end": 2225, "label": "MEAS_SIZE"}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2237, "label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT"}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2252, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2259, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2276, "label": "ANAT_AIRWAY"}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2292, "label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2362, "label": "MEDICATION"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2367, "label": "MEDICATION"}, {"start": 2377, "end": 2383, "label": "MEDICATION"}, {"start": 2403, "end": 2418, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2499, "label": "MEDICATION"}, {"start": 2534, "end": 2546, "label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"}, {"start": 2601, "end": 2611, "label": "DEV_CATHETER"}, {"start": 2667, "end": 2670, "label": "OBS_FINDING"}, {"start": 2784, "end": 2795, "label": "MEDICATION"}, {"start": 2800, "end": 2818, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 2857, "end": 2865, "label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"}, {"start": 2897, "end": 2900, "label": "MEDICATION"}, {"start": 3041, "end": 3044, "label": "OBS_FINDING"}, {"start": 3092, "end": 3097, "label": "OBS_LESION"}, {"start": 3129, "end": 3139, "label": "DEV_CATHETER"}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3209, "label": "OBS_FINDING"}, {"start": 3241, "end": 3246, "label": "CTX_TIME"}, {"start": 3267, "end": 3277, "label": "CTX_TIME"}, {"start": 3281, "end": 3284, "label": "PROC_ACTION"}, {"start": 3441, "end": 3462, "label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION"}]}

The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.\nThe trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp.\nThe tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal;\nthere are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  The proximal and mid left mainstem were normal.\nIn the distal left mainstem a white fungating tumor was seen causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and extending from the left lower lobe bronchus to causing complete obstruction of the lingula and 80% obstruction of the left mainstem.\nThe LMA was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator.\nThe rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.\nWe then utilized cryoextraction to remove large pieces of tumor piece meal.\nMost of the superficial tumor was avascular and did not bleed but as we continued debulking into less necrotic tumor mild bleeding occurred and was treated with cold saline flushes.\nAfter extensive debulking we were able to advance the bronchoscope into the lingula were some purulent secretions were seen and performed mini BAL.\nThe tumor however extended into the subsegments of the lingula and deemed likely not salvageable with endobronchial treatment alone.\nAPC was then used to coagulate the residual superficial layer of oozing tumor.\nAt the end of the procedure distal left mainstem was only 15% obstructed.\nThe left upper lobe proper (anterior and apical posterior segments) were completely patent.\nThe lingula was 80% obstructed and the left lower lobe remained completely obstructed with distal tumor.\nOnce we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\nRecommendations:\nTransfer to PACU and then home once discharge criteria met.\nWill discuss with oncology if biopsy samples obtained during procedure need any specific mutational analysis.\nDefer to oncology regarding medical and radiation treatment. \nWill monitor for symptoms or radiographic signs of tumor regrowth and possible need for repeat debulking to salvage left upper lobe.", "entities": [{"start": 69, "end": 88, "label": "OBS_LESION", "text": "Malignant lung mass"}, {"start": 94, "end": 109, "label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "text": "left lower lobe"}, {"start": 122,

Rigid bronchoscopy\n2. Balloon dilation of tracheal stenosis\n3. Biodegradable tracheal stent placement (BD-Stent, Merit Endotek)\n\nINDICATION: 46-year-old male with history of prolonged intubation (28 days) for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 in 2021. Developed tracheal stenosis requiring multiple dilations. Has failed 3 prior balloon dilations with recurrence within 4-6 weeks. After discussion of options including T-tube, surgical resection, and biodegradable stent, patient elected for biodegradable stent trial given relatively young age and desire to avoid permanent stent or surgery.\n\nANESTHESIA: Total intravenous anesthesia (propofol/remifentanil)\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nUnder TIVA, rigid bronchoscopy performed using 12mm Storz ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Airway anatomy:\n- Subglottic region: Normal\n- Tracheal stenosis: Located 2.5cm below vocal cords, approximately 8mm thick web-like stenosis narrowing the lumen to 5mm (Grade III, Myer-Cotton)\n- Distal trachea and bilateral mainstem: Normal\n\nBalloon dilation performed using 15mm x 40mm CRE balloon (Boston Scientific). Balloon inflated to 8 ATM x 60 seconds x 3 inflations with radial fracturing of the stenosis observed. Post-dilation diameter approximately 12mm.\n\nMerit Endotek BD-Stent (18mm diameter x 30mm length, polydioxanone-based) selected based on tracheal measurements. Stent delivery system advanced through the rigid bronchoscope and deployed under direct visualization with the proximal and distal markers positioned 1cm beyond the stenosis margins. Stent expanded fully to approximately 16mm. Confirmation of good apposition to tracheal wall.\n\nPost-procedure bronchoscopy confirmed patent airway through the stent with no evidence of stent migration. Mucosa intact with minimal bleeding from dilation site.\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: <5mL\n\nDISPOSITION: PACU recovery, discharge home same day with post-procedure instructions. No activity restrictions. Soft diet x 24 hours.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n- Bronchoscopy in 8 weeks for stent assessment\n- BD-Stent expected to degrade over 4-6 months\n- CT airway in 3 months\n\nDr. Rachel Kim, MD\nDr. Ahmed Hassan,

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to tunneled pleural catheter placement were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent malignant pleural effusion, right\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Indwelling Tunneled Pleural Catheter Placement (CPT 32550)\nATTENDING: Dr. Rachel Green\nASSISTANT: Dr. Paul Anderson, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Jennifer Martinez\nRT: David Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with Lidocaine 1%\nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, blood pressure\nINSTRUMENT: CareFusion PleurX catheter system, ultrasound machine\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT [REDACTED]: Sitting upright at 60 degrees, right arm elevated\nCHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: (Image saved and printed)\n\nHemithorax: Right\nPleural Effusion Volume: Large\nEchogenicity: Anechoic\nLoculations: None\nDiaphragmatic Motion: Diminished\nLung sliding before procedure: Present\nLung consolidation/atelectasis: Present (compressive atelectasis)\nPleura: Mildly thickened, no nodularity visualized\n\nThe right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to id[REDACTED] the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.\nANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract\nEntry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space\nLocation: [REDACTED]\nProcedure Steps:\n\nA finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038\" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.\nTwo 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.\nThe tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.\nSerial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).\nThe introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).\nThe catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.\nSterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).\n\nExit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line\nInitial Drainage:\nThe PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.\n\nFluid Removed: 1200 mL\nAppearance: Serous, straw-colored\n\nPleural Pressures Measured:\n\nOpening: -8 cmH₂O\n500ml: -10 cmH₂O\n1000ml: -15 cmH₂O\n1200ml: -18 cmH₂O (stopped due to chest discomfort)\n\nDrainage device: Initially vacuum bottle, then capped after drainage complete\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nPost-procedure ultrasound showed reduced effusion volume with no pneumothorax. Post-procedure CXR ordered.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with only mild discomfort during catheter insertion. The attending, Dr. Green, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. [REDACTED] underwent successful placement of right-sided tunneled pleural catheter for recurrent malignant effusion.

The primary indication for this procedure encompassed peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 19.4 mm solid pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RUL anterior (B3), with positive bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 6.7.\n\nANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 2. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE\n\nCOMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION\n\nThe convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC180F) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.\n\nStation 10R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 21.2 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma. Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 8.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 13.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nCOMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.5 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).\n\nRadial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.\n\nRAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\nOn-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed granuloma.\n\nPROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS\n\nThe procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.

The indication was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis with a 16.3mm ground-glass lesion in the RLL superior (B6), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 6.9. The patient was ASA class 2 with smoking history of 23 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope with 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 11L (14.4mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Granuloma); station 4L (21.7mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 10L (19.2mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system (Noah Medical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 3.4mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RLL superior (B6) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed adjacent view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by radial ebus. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 94 minutes.

{"id": "1248551", "text": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY PROCEDURE DOCUMENTATION\n\nPatient [REDACTED]: Amanda Kim\nMedical Record [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\nDate of Birth: [REDACTED] (Age: 67 years)\nBiological Sex: Female\nDate of Procedure: [REDACTED]\nInstitution: [REDACTED]\n\nCLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION\n\nThis 67-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 21.6 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RUL anterior (B3), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. \n\nANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE\n\nCOMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION\n\nThe convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Fujifilm EB-580S) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.\n\nStation 10L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 13.0 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 4L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 19.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nCOMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.8 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).\n\nRadial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated eccentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via cbct.\n\nTissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (8 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.\n\nRAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\nOn-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed granuloma.\n\nPROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS\n\nThe procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RUL pulmonary lesion\n3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - nsclc nos\n4.

Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.\nWe discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.\nProcedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement\nHow it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.\nThrough the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.\nMultiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.\nAfter biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.\nPathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry\nPatient [REDACTED] throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.\nFollow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation. Patient understands may need indwelling pleural catheter if lung doesn't re-expand.", "entities": [{"label": "LATERALITY", "start": 180, "end": 191, "text": "right sided"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 192, "end": 208, "text": "pleural effusion"}, {"label": "CTX_HISTORICAL", "start": 228, "end": 236, "text": "Previous"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 237, "end": 250, "text": "thoracentesis"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 258, "end": 273, "text": "exudative fluid"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 307, "end": 325, "text": "pleural thickening"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 307, "end": 314, "text": "pleural"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 341, "end": 351, "text": "malignancy"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 426, "end": 446, "text": "medical thoracoscopy"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 508, "end": 518, "text": "chest tube"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 673, "end": 693, "text": "Medical thoracoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 707, "end": 715, "text": "biopsies"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 717, "end": 721, "text": "talc"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 722, "end": 733, "text": "pleurodesis"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 735, "end": 745, "text": "chest tube"}, {"label": "LATERALITY", "start": 819, "end": 824, "text": "Right"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 825, "end": 835, "text": "hemithorax"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 884, "end": 905, "text": "5th intercostal space"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 947, "end": 955, "text": "effusion"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 1012, "end": 1021, "text": "lidocaine"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1085, "end": 1098, "text": "pleural space"}, {"label": "MEAS_PLEURAL_DRAIN", "start": 1131, "end": 1135, "text": "28Fr"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1132, "end": 1133, "text": "8"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 1136, "end": 1146, "text": "chest tube"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 1209, "end": 1214, "text": "800mL"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1218, "end": 1230, "text": "bloody fluid"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1292, "end": 1310, "text": "rigid thoracoscope"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1316, "end": 1329, "text": "pleural space"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1390, "end": 1405, "text": "parietal pleura"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1428, "end": 1443, "text": "nodular lesions"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1459, "end": 1464, "text": "1.5cm"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1492, "end": 1507, "text": "visceral pleura"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1530, "end": 1537, "text": "nodules"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1557, "end": 1573, "text": "thickened pleura"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_PLEURAL", "start": 1575, "end": 1596, "text": "Lung appeared trapped"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1651, "end": 1660, "text": "adhesions"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1672, "end": 1677, "text": "lysed"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1710, "end": 1718, "text": "biopsies"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1740, "end": 1748, "text": "parietal"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1753, "end": 1768, "text": "visceral pleura"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1775, "end": 1789, "text": "biopsy forceps"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1910, "end": 1918, "text": "biopsies"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 1961, "end": 1965, "text": "talc"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1966, "end": 1977, "text": "pleurodesis"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_PLEURAL", "start": 2018, "end": 2030, "text": "trapped lung"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 2057, "end": 2076, "text": "sterile talc slurry"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 2086, "end": 2090, "text": "50mL"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2109, "end": 2120, "text": "insufflated"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 2136, "end": 2150, "text": "pleural cavity"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 2183, "end": 2193, "text": "chest tube"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 2278, "end": 2285, "text": "Pleural"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2295, "end": 2297, "text": "x8"}, {"label": "SPECIMEN", "start": 2311, "end": 2324, "text": "pleural fluid"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2383, "end": 2399, "text": "No complications"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 2427, "end": 2437, "text": "chest tube"}, {"label": "MEAS_PRESS", "start": 2452, "end": 2460, "text": "-20cmH2O"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 2524, "end": 2534, "text": "Chest tube"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_PLEURAL", "start": 2573, "end": 2585, "text": "trapped lung"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 2691, "end": 2718, "text": "indwelling pleural catheter"}]}

{"id": "1350268", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], Jonathan Wood, a 54-year-old female patient, presented to Memorial Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Michael Rodriguez, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 28.6 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 8.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 36 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 17.1 millimeters in short axis and 25.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 8.4 millimeters in short axis and 34.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 22.2 millimeters in short axis and 34.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.9 millimeters in short axis and 28.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 18.5 millimeters in short axis and 22.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:02, for a total procedure time of 92 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nMichael Rodriguez, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology", "entities": [{"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 189, "end": 213, "text": "endobronchial ultrasound"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 245, "end": 265, "text": "robotic bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 271, "end": 293, "text": "peripheral lung biopsy"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 397, "end": 413, "text": "right upper lobe"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 414, "end": 418, "text": "mass"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 496, "end": 511, "text": "28.6 millimeter"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 525, "end": 541, "text": "pulmonary nodule"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 557, "end": 560, "text": "RLL"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 591, "end": 617, "text": "lateral basal (B9) segment"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 651, "end": 659, "text": "bronchus"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 845, "end": 851, "text": "nodule"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1278, "end": 1292, "text": "8.0 millimeter"}, {"label": "CTX_TIME", "start": 1339, "end": 1344, "text": "09:30"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1444, "end": 1475, "text": "linear endobronchial ultrasound"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1481, "end": 1502, "text": "Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1503, "end": 1515, "text": "bronchoscope"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1731, "end": 1742, "text": "station 10R"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1798, "end": 1814, "text": "17.1 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1833, "end": 1849, "text": "25.9 millimeters"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1907, "end": 1915, "text": "21-gauge"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1916, "end": 1922, "text": "needle"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1924, "end": 1925, "text": "2"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1926, "end": 1936, "text": "aspiration"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2024, "end": 2038, "text": "atypical cells"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 2043, "end": 2054, "text": "station 11R"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2108, "end": 2123, "text": "8.4 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2110, "end": 2111, "text": "4"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2142, "end": 2158, "text": "34.2 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2143, "end": 2144, "text": "4"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2145, "end": 2146, "text": "2"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2217, "end": 2225, "text": "21-gauge"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2236, "end": 2246, "text": "aspiration"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2334, "end": 2343, "text": "granuloma"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 2348, "end": 2359, "text": "station 11L"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2413, "end": 2429, "text": "22.2 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2448, "end": 2464, "text": "34.6 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2449, "end": 2450, "text": "4"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2527, "end": 2535, "text": "21-gauge"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2544, "end": 2545, "text": "4"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2546, "end": 2556, "text": "aspiration"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2644, "end": 2670, "text": "malignant -

{"id": "1377952", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], [REDACTED], a 41-year-old male patient, presented to Memorial Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Robert Patel, MD, with Priya Sharma assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 24.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the superior lingula (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 49 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.5 millimeters in short axis and 32.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.1 millimeters in short axis and 12.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 8.8 millimeters in short axis and 15.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL superior lingula (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:18, for a total procedure time of 108 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition.

ETT secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nTrachea normal caliber, carina sharp. Bilateral airways inspected to subsegmental level. No endobronchial lesions. Minimal secretions cleared.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPCV\t10\t342\t16\t80\t8\t20\n\nThe single-use disposable Noah Galaxy bronchoscope was introduced into the airway. Navigational registration was performed using the electromagnetic field generator placed beneath the patient.\n\nThe scope was navigated to the approximate target location in the RLL (RB6) based on the pre-operative CT navigational plan. Registration accuracy: 3.8mm.\n\nOnce in the target vicinity, a Tool-in-Lesion Tomosynthesis (TiLT+) sweep was performed using the C-arm. The system generated an updated intra-operative 3D volume, revealing a 1.7cm divergence between the pre-op CT target and the actual lesion location due to atelectasis.\n\nThe augmented reality target was updated on the navigation screen to match real-time anatomy. Intra-operative tomosynthesis (TiLT) performed to update target location and correct for divergence.\n\nThe scope was adjusted to align with the corrected TiLT target. Confirmation of tool position was verified using the augmented fluoroscopy overlay provided by the TiLT system.\n\nRadial EBUS performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Concentric.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 22G needle. 7 passes obtained. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed. 4 specimens obtained under fluoroscopic guidance with TiLT overlay. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nCytology brushings obtained. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nGold fiducial marker placed under TiLT-augmented fluoroscopic guidance for SBRT planning.\n\nROSE Result: Atypical cells present, suspicious for malignancy\n\nFinal airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or complications. The disposable Galaxy scope was removed and discarded at the end of the case.\n\nPatient [REDACTED] well.

{"id": "1472710", "text": "OPERATIVE REPORT - INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY / THORACIC SURGERY\n\nDATE: [REDACTED]\nPATIENT: [REDACTED]\nMRN: [REDACTED]\nDOB: [REDACTED] (64 years old)\n\nSURGEONS:\nIP: Dr. Mark Anderson, MD (started case)\nThoracic Surgery: Dr. Sarah Kim, MD (completed case after conversion)\n\nLOCATION: [REDACTED]\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right-sided exudative pleural effusion, unknown etiology\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dense pleural adhesions with loculated effusion; trapped lung\n\nPLANNED PROCEDURE: Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with pleural biopsy and potential talc poudrage\n\nACTUAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED:\n1. Attempted medical thoracoscopy (aborted)\n2. Conversion to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery)\n3. VATS lysis of adhesions\n4. VATS pleural biopsy\n5. Decortication (partial)\n6. Chest tube placement\n\nINDICATION: 64-year-old female with 2-month history of progressive dyspnea. CT chest revealed large right pleural effusion with mild enhancement of pleura concerning for malignancy. Thoracentesis x 2 showed exudative effusion with negative cytology. Medical thoracoscopy planned for definitive diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube (left-sided)\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\n\nMEDICAL THORACOSCOPY ATTEMPT (Dr. Anderson):\nPatient [REDACTED] left lateral decubitus. After induction of general anesthesia and lung isolation, the right chest was prepped and draped. Ultrasound examination revealed a small pocket of fluid in the mid-axillary line but significant lung adherence to chest wall throughout.\n\nA 2cm incision was made in the 6th intercostal space. Upon blunt dissection into the pleural space, immediate dense adhesions were encountered. The 7mm trocar could not be safely advanced due to extensive lung-to-chest-wall adhesions. A small pocket of loculated fluid (~200mL) was drained but no window could be created for safe pleuroscopy. Multiple attempts at different intercostal spaces (5th, 7th) encountered similar dense adhesions.\n\nDECISION TO CONVERT: After thorough discussion with thoracic surgery colleagues and the patient's family (who had been counseled preoperatively about this possibility), the decision was made to convert to VATS for safe completion of the procedure.\n\nVATS PROCEDURE (Dr. Kim):\nThe incision was extended and a 10mm port placed under direct vision where a small pleural space was id[REDACTED]. Two additional 5mm ports were placed. Dense adhesions were found throughout the hemithorax. Using a combination of blunt dissection, electrocautery, and harmonic scalpel, extensive adhesiolysis was performed over approximately 90 minutes.\n\nFindings:\n- Dense fibrinous adhesions throughout\n- Thickened visceral pleura with trapped lung\n- Nodular thickening of parietal pleura (multiple biopsies taken)\n- Approximately 500mL of loculated, amber-colored fluid drained\n\nMultiple parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from chest wall and diaphragmatic pleura. Partial decortication of the visceral pleura was performed to allow lung expansion, though complete expansion could not be achieved due to chronic entrapment.\n\nA 28Fr chest tube was placed. Negative-pressure water seal established. Lung expansion approximately 70% at end of case.\n\nSPECIMENS:\n- Pleural fluid: Cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures, adenosine deaminase\n- Pleural biopsies (multiple): Surgical pathology\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150mL\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively. Conversion was planned contingency.\n\nDISPOSITION: Transferred to SICU for overnight monitoring. Chest tube to suction.\n\nPOST-OPERATIVE PLAN:\n1. Monitor chest tube output\n2. CXR in AM\n3. Await pathology - concern for malignant mesothelioma or chronic fibrinous pleuritis\n4. If lung remains trapped, may require chronic indwelling pleural catheter\n\nDr. Mark Anderson, MD - Interventional Pulmonology\nDr. Sarah Kim, MD - Thoracic Surgery", "entities": [{"label":

After successful induction of general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, a time-out was performed verifying correct patient, procedure, and photosensitizer administration timing.\nInitial Bronchoscopic Survey:\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic examination revealed:\n\nUpper airways: Normal\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\nRight bronchial tree: Entirely normal, no endobronchial lesions\nLeft bronchial tree: Endobronchial tumor visible in left mainstem bronchus\n\nTumor Characteristics (Pre-PDT measurements):\n\nLocation: Left mainstem bronchus, 2cm distal to carina on medial wall\nSize: 1.8cm (longitudinal) × 0.9cm (circumferential extent)\nMorphology: Flat, slightly raised plaque-like lesion\nColor: Pink-red with areas of white keratinization\nSurface: Irregular, slightly friable appearance\nObstruction: Approximately 30% luminal narrowing\nDistal airways: LUL and LLL fully patent\n\nPhotodynamic Therapy Light Delivery:\nLaser safety protocols confirmed (room signage, protective eyewear, fire safety measures in place). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The fiber was positioned to center the tumor within the treatment field. Distance measurements confirmed using bronchoscope markings.\nTreatment Parameters:\n\nWavelength: 630 nm (red laser light, optimal for Photofrin activation)\nPower output: 400 mW/cm of diffuser length\nDiffuser length: 2.5 cm\nTotal power: 1000 mW (1.0 W)\nLight dose (fluence): 200 J/cm² of diffuser surface\nTreatment time: 500 seconds (8 minutes 20 seconds)\nCalculation: 200 J/cm² ÷ 0.4 W/cm = 500 seconds\n\nLight was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:\n\nLaser energy meter verified consistent power output\nNo visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)\nNo charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)\nPatient [REDACTED] throughout\nNo arrhythmias or desaturations\n\nPost-Treatment Assessment:\nImmediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.\nLight Precautions Review:\nPost-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:\n\nStrict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum\nWear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors\nGradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing\nEmergency contact information provided\nWritten instructions given\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.\nSPECIMENS\nNone (non-excisional therapy)\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\nThis 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven [REDACTED]) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.\nTimeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:\n\nScheduled debridement bronchoscopy: [REDACTED] (48 hours post-light)\nAnticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal\nWill assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed\n\nOngoing Management:\n\nContinue light precautions (patient education reinforced)\nMonitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions\nDexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)\nPPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)\nDebridement session in 2 days\n\nLong-term surveillance:\nBronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.\nProcedure Note - EBV Removal\nPatient [REDACTED] 59M MRN [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Dr. Amanda Foster attending\nIndication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.\nPatient [REDACTED] OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.\nValve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.\nValve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.\nValve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.\nAfter valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.\nLeft lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.\nSpecimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.\nFollow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve.

{"id": "1528559", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], Dorothy Price, a 53-year-old female patient, presented to Community Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Andrew Nakamura, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.3 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the superior (B6) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 23 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 14.4 millimeters in short axis and 23.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.7 millimeters in short axis and 20.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 19.2 millimeters in short axis and 34.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.4 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL superior (B6). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:49, for a total procedure time of 94 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nAndrew Nakamura, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology", "entities": [{"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 67, "end": 68, "text": "3"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 190, "end": 214, "text": "endobronchial ultrasound"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 246, "end": 266, "text": "robotic bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 288, "end": 294, "text": "biopsy"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 461, "end": 467, "text": "nodule"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 520, "end": 535, "text": "16.3 millimeter"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 559, "end": 565, "text": "nodule"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 581, "end": 589, "text": "RLL lobe"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 615, "end": 636, "text": "superior (B6) segment"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 626, "end": 627, "text": "6"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 864, "end": 870, "text": "nodule"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1070, "end": 1071, "text": "2"}, {"label": "CTX_HISTORICAL", "start": 1089, "end": 1102, "text": "former smoker"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1297, "end": 1311, "text": "8.0 millimeter"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1312, "end": 1329, "text": "endotracheal tube"}, {"label": "CTX_TIME", "start": 1358, "end": 1363, "text": "08:15"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1463, "end": 1494, "text": "linear endobronchial ultrasound"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1518, "end": 1530, "text": "bronchoscope"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1746, "end": 1757, "text": "station 11L"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1813, "end": 1829, "text": "14.4 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1814, "end": 1815, "text": "4"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1816, "end": 1817, "text": "4"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1848, "end": 1864, "text": "23.4 millimeters"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1923, "end": 1931, "text": "22-gauge"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2040, "end": 2049, "text": "granuloma"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 2054, "end": 2064, "text": "station 4L"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2118, "end": 2134, "text": "21.7 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2153, "end": 2169, "text": "20.3 millimeters"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2227, "end": 2235, "text": "22-gauge"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2344, "end": 2365, "text": "malignant - nsclc nos"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 2370, "end": 2381, "text": "station 10L"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2435, "end": 2451, "text": "19.2 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2470, "end": 2486, "text": "34.4 millimeters"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2549, "end": 2557, "text": "22-gauge"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2666, "end": 2692, "text": "malignant - adenocarcinoma"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2784, "end": 2804, "text": "robotic bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 3188, "end": 3205, "text": "RLL superior (B6)"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 3311, "end": 3342, "text": "radial endobronchial ultrasound"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 3568, "end": 3579, "text": "radial ebus"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 3688, "end": 3695, "text": "forceps"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 3696, "end": 3704, "text": "biopsies"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 3742, "end": 3774, "text": "Transbronchial needle aspiration"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 3827, "end": 3845, "text": "bronchial brushing"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 3953, "end": 3988, "text": "malignant - squamous cell carcinoma"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 3999, "end": 4021, "text": "bronchoalveolar lavage"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 4045, "end": 4053, "text": "RLL lobe"}, {"label": "CTX_TIME", "start": 4185, "end": 4190, "text": "09:49"}, {"label": "CTX_TIME", "start": 4222, "end": 4232, "text": "94 minutes"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 4234, "end": 4250, "text": "No complications"}]}

After successful induction of general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, a time-out was performed verifying correct patient, procedure, and photosensitizer administration timing.\nInitial Bronchoscopic Survey:\nThe bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic examination revealed:\n\nUpper airways: Normal\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nCarina: Sharp, normal\nRight bronchial tree: Entirely normal, no endobronchial lesions\nLeft bronchial tree: Endobronchial tumor visible in left mainstem bronchus\n\nTumor Characteristics (Pre-PDT measurements):\n\nLocation: Left mainstem bronchus, 2cm distal to carina on medial wall\nSize: 1.8cm (longitudinal) × 0.9cm (circumferential extent)\nMorphology: Flat, slightly raised plaque-like lesion\nColor: Pink-red with areas of white keratinization\nSurface: Irregular, slightly friable appearance\nObstruction: Approximately 30% luminal narrowing\nDistal airways: LUL and LLL fully patent\n\nPhotodynamic Therapy Light Delivery:\nLaser safety protocols confirmed (room signage, protective eyewear, fire safety measures in place). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The fiber was positioned to center the tumor within the treatment field. Distance measurements confirmed using bronchoscope markings.\nTreatment Parameters:\n\nWavelength: 630 nm (red laser light, optimal for Photofrin activation)\nPower output: 400 mW/cm of diffuser length\nDiffuser length: 2.5 cm\nTotal power: 1000 mW (1.0 W)\nLight dose (fluence): 200 J/cm² of diffuser surface\nTreatment time: 500 seconds (8 minutes 20 seconds)\nCalculation: 200 J/cm² ÷ 0.4 W/cm = 500 seconds\n\nLight was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:\n\nLaser energy meter verified consistent power output\nNo visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)\nNo charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)\nPatient [REDACTED] throughout\nNo arrhythmias or desaturations\n\nPost-Treatment Assessment:\nImmediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.\nLight Precautions Review:\nPost-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:\n\nStrict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum\nWear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors\nGradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing\nEmergency contact information provided\nWritten instructions given\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.\nSPECIMENS\nNone (non-excisional therapy)\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\nThis 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven [REDACTED]) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.\nTimeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:\n\nScheduled debridement bronchoscopy: [REDACTED] (48 hours post-light)\nAnticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal\nWill assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed\n\nOngoing Management:\n\nContinue light precautions (patient education reinforced)\nMonitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions\nDexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)\nPPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)\nDebridement session in 2 days\n\nLong-term surveillance:\nBronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.\nProcedure Note - EBV Removal\nPatient [REDACTED] 59M MRN [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Dr. Amanda Foster attending\nIndication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.\nPatient [REDACTED] OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.\nValve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.\nValve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.\nValve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.\nAfter valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.\nLeft lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.\nSpecimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.\nFollow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve.

{"id": "1690514", "text": "Bronchoscopy Note\nPatient: [REDACTED], 58 yo female\nDate: [REDACTED]\nDoc: Dr. Steven Park\nMRN: [REDACTED]\nSo [REDACTED] today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.\nBrought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).\nSo here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.\nAfter cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.\nThe distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.\nDid a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.\nRecommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.\nOverall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.", "entities": [{"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 0, "end": 12, "text": "Bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 142, "end": 147, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "CTX_TIME", "start": 167, "end": 175, "text": "3 months"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 205, "end": 209, "text": "14mm"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL", "start": 210, "end": 215, "text": "Dumon"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL", "start": 216, "end": 224, "text": "silicone"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 225, "end": 230, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 238, "end": 251, "text": "left mainstem"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 497, "end": 503, "text": "versed"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 508, "end": 516, "text": "fentanyl"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 538, "end": 546, "text": "propofol"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 584, "end": 589, "text": "scope"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 605, "end": 610, "text": "trach"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 635, "end": 640, "text": "trach"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 665, "end": 670, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 740, "end": 747, "text": "trachea"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 758, "end": 763, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 795, "end": 805, "text": "secretions"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 844, "end": 849, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 952, "end": 966, "text": "mucous buildup"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1030, "end": 1040, "text": "suctioning"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1045, "end": 1051, "text": "toilet"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1059, "end": 1064, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1087, "end": 1115, "text": "thick tan-colored secretions"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1105, "end": 1115, "text": "secretions"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1127, "end": 1142, "text": "cleaning it out"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1179, "end": 1184, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1194, "end": 1217, "text": "mild granulation tissue"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1484, "end": 1489, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1543, "end": 1546, "text": "LUL"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1551, "end": 1554, "text": "LLL"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1576, "end": 1581, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1607, "end": 1612, "text": "tumor"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1625, "end": 1630, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1709, "end": 1714, "text": "Stent"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST", "start": 1797, "end": 1808, "text": "80% patency"}, {"label": "CTX_TIME", "start": 2019, "end": 2026, "text": "4 weeks"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 2064, "end": 2082, "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 2234, "end": 2246, "text": "azithromycin"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 2322, "end": 2327, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 2387, "end": 2403, "text": "secretion burden"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 2430, "end": 2448, "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2488, "end": 2504, "text": "no complications"}]}

The indication was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a 14.5mm ground-glass lesion in the RUL anterior (B3), bronchus sign positive. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 50 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope with 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 11L (13.3mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 7 (10.0mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 2L (24.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system (Auris Health (J&J)) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 3.2mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RUL anterior (B3) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed concentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by radial ebus. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed atypical cells.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL.

Rigid bronchoscopy with stent removal\n2. Bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial granulation tissue using APC\n\nINDICATION: 69-year-old male with history of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy complicated by recurrent stricture of airway fistula 18 months ago for which a covered SEMS was placed in the right mainstem bronchus. Recent CT showed stent fracture with proximal wire protruding into the trachea. Patient symptomatic with worsening cough and hemoptysis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 12mm Bryan-Dumon ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Examination of the trachea revealed the fractured proximal portion of the right mainstem SEMS protruding approximately 1.5cm into the distal trachea. The fractured wire ends were sharp and had caused mucosal injury with surrounding granulation tissue formation.\n\nA flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid scope to examine beyond the stent. The stent lumen was narrowed by approximately 40% due to granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal end. The distal right bronchus intermedius appeared patent.\n\nThe granulation tissue was treated with APC (ERBE VIO, 30W, Effect 2) at the proximal stent margin, achieving adequate hemostasis and improving visualization.\n\nUsing a combination of rigid optical forceps and alligator forceps, the proximal edge of the stent was grasped. The stent was collapsed using the forceps in a rolling fashion and withdrawn en bloc through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nInspection of the airway post-removal revealed:\n- Mild residual granulation tissue at the former stent site (treated with APC)\n- No perforation or significant bleeding\n- Bronchus intermedius patent\n- Right upper, middle, and lower lobe orifices patent\n\nFinal inspection showed no debris, no significant bleeding, patent airways bilaterally. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMENS: None (stent sent to pathology for documentation)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nEBL: 15mL\n\nDISPOSITION: Same day discharge anticipated. Follow-up bronchoscopy in 6 weeks to assess granulation tissue recurrence.\n\nDr. David Chen, MD\nDr. Katherine Wong, MD", "entities": [{"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 310, "end": 333, "text": "right mainstem bronchus"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 334, "end": 363, "text": "self-expanding metallic stent"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 365, "end": 369, "text": "SEMS"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 403, "end": 408, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 409, "end": 427, "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 463, "end": 481, "text": "Rigid bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 487, "end": 500, "text": "stent removal"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 487, "end": 492, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 504, "end": 516, "text": "Bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 522, "end": 533, "text": "destruction"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 551, "end": 569, "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 576, "end": 579, "text": "APC"}, {"label": "CTX_HISTORICAL", "start": 615, "end": 625, "text": "history of"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 626, "end": 643, "text": "esophageal cancer"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL", "start": 749, "end": 756, "text": "covered"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 757, "end": 761, "text": "SEMS"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 780, "end": 803, "text": "right mainstem bronchus"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 822, "end": 836, "text": "stent fracture"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 822, "end": 827, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 876, "end": 883, "text": "trachea"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 930, "end": 940, "text": "hemoptysis"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 975, "end": 990, "text": "jet ventilation"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1077, "end": 1081, "text": "12mm"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1106, "end": 1124, "text": "rigid bronchoscope"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1145, "end": 1152, "text": "trachea"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1215, "end": 1219, "text": "SEMS"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1245, "end": 1250, "text": "1.5cm"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1267, "end": 1274, "text": "trachea"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1358, "end": 1376, "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1391, "end": 1412, "text": "flexible bronchoscope"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1470, "end": 1475, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1481, "end": 1486, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE", "start": 1497, "end": 1526, "text": "narrowed by approximately 40%"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1534, "end": 1552, "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1600, "end": 1620, "text": "bronchus intermedius"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1630, "end": 1636, "text": "patent"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1643, "end": 1661, "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1679, "end": 1682, "text": "APC"}, {"label": "MEAS_ENERGY", "start": 1694, "end": 1697, "text": "30W"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1725, "end": 1730, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1822, "end": 1843, "text": "rigid optical forceps"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1848, "end": 1865, "text": "alligator forceps"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1945, "end": 1952, "text": "forceps"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 2008, "end": 2026, "text": "rigid bronchoscope"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 2093, "end": 2111, "text": "granulation tissue"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2151, "end": 2154, "text": "APC"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2158, "end": 2172, "text": "No perforation"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 2199, "end": 2219, "text": "Bronchus intermedius"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST", "start": 2220, "end": 2226, "text": "patent"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 2229, "end": 2240, "text": "Right upper"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 2242, "end": 2248, "text": "middle"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 2254, "end": 2264, "text": "lower lobe"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST", "start": 2274, "end": 2280, "text": "patent"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2317, "end": 2340, "text": "no significant bleeding"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST", "start": 2342, "end": 2348, "text": "patent"}, {"label": "LATERALITY", "start": 2357, "end": 2368, "text": "bilaterally"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 2529, "end": 2533, "text": "15mL"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 2624, "end": 2642, "text": "granulation tissue"}]}

The primary indication for this procedure encompassed peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 14.0 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 17.6.\n\nANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 2. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE\n\nCOMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION\n\nThe convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Pentax EB-1990i) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.\n\nStation 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 14.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 4L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 24.3 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Station 10R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 12.9 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 10L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 18.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed suspicious for malignancy. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 18.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nCOMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.5 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2).\n\nRadial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.\n\nRAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\nOn-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS\n\nThe procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.

Topical 1% lidocaine applied to the oropharynx and vocal cords. The patient maintained spontaneous ventilation via native airway with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter a time-out and confirmation of consent, a flexible adult bronchoscope was introduced orally with a bite block. The vocal cords were mobile and normal in appearance. The trachea and main carina were normal with mild extrinsic impression at the subcarinal region but no endobronchial tumor. The right and left bronchial trees were inspected to the subsegmental level without obstructing lesions.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 21-gauge Wang transbronchial aspiration needle was passed through the working channel. Using anatomic landmarks only (no EBUS or ultrasound), multiple passes were made through the bronchial wall just proximal to the main carina targeting the subcarinal (station 7) lymph node seen on imaging (short-axis 15 mm). Four needle passes were performed with suction applied on each pass, yielding blood-tinged material with visible tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: An on-site cytotechnologist was present. Rapid on-site evaluation showed abundant lymphocytes with clusters of malignant epithelial cells, consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Adequacy was confirmed after the third pass; a fourth pass was performed for cell block and ancillary studies.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 7 conventional TBNA x4 passes, submitted for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry with reflex molecular studies if malignant.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Minimal oozing at the puncture site resolved with suction and cold saline. No significant bleeding, hypoxia, or hemodynamic instability. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigational bronchoscopy was used at any point; this was a purely conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was monitored in the bronchoscopy recovery area and discharged home in stable condition. Final cytology, cell block, and molecular profiling from station 7 will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board. Further management (surgical resection versus chemoradiation or systemic therapy) will be based on complete staging results.", "entities": [{"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 136, "end": 157, "text": "Flexible bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 163, "end": 175, "text": "conventional"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 176, "end": 208, "text": "transbronchial needle aspiration"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 210, "end": 214, "text": "TBNA"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 219, "end": 240, "text": "subcarinal lymph node"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 242, "end": 251, "text": "station 7"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 259, "end": 270, "text": "Wang needle"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 295, "end": 311, "text": "Right lower lobe"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 312, "end": 321, "text": "lung mass"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 336, "end": 362, "text": "subcarinal lymphadenopathy"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 336, "end": 346, "text": "subcarinal"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 483, "end": 492, "text": "midazolam"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 497, "end": 505, "text": "fentanyl"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 556, "end": 565, "text": "lidocaine"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 596, "end": 607, "text": "vocal cords"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 789, "end": 816, "text": "flexible adult bronchoscope"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 862, "end": 873, "text": "vocal cords"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 916, "end": 923, "text": "trachea"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 928, "end": 939, "text": "main carina"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 962, "end": 982, "text": "extrinsic impression"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1029, "end": 1034, "text": "tumor"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1142, "end": 1154, "text": "CONVENTIONAL"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1155, "end": 1159, "text": "TBNA"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1161, "end": 1172, "text": "WANG NEEDLE"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1177, "end": 1185, "text": "21-gauge"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1186, "end": 1223, "text": "Wang transbronchial aspiration needle"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1270, "end": 1288, "text": "anatomic landmarks"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1298, "end": 1302, "text": "EBUS"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1306, "end": 1316, "text": "ultrasound"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1393, "end": 1404, "text": "main carina"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1431, "end": 1440, "text": "station 7"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1442, "end": 1452, "text": "lymph node"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1481, "end": 1486, "text": "15 mm"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1489, "end": 1507, "text": "Four needle passes"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 1709, "end": 1720, "text": "lymphocytes"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 1738, "end": 1764, "text": "malignant epithelial cells"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 1782, "end": 1802, "text": "metastatic carcinoma"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1927, "end": 1936, "text": "Station 7"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1937, "end": 1949, "text": "conventional"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1950, "end": 1954, "text": "TBNA"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1956, "end": 1964, "text": "4 passes"}, {"label": "SPECIMEN", "start": 1980, "end": 1988, "text": "cytology"}, {"label": "SPECIMEN", "start": 1990, "end": 2000, "text": "cell block"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 2081, "end": 2095, "text": "Minimal oozing"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2156, "end": 2179, "text": "No significant bleeding"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2221, "end": 2232, "text": "linear EBUS"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2234, "end": 2245, "text": "radial EBUS"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2250, "end": 2275, "text": "navigational bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2317, "end": 2329, "text": "conventional"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2330, "end": 2335, "text": "blind"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2336, "end": 2347, "text": "Wang needle"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2348, "end": 2352, "text": "TBNA"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 2531, "end": 2540, "text": "station 7"}]}

Size 8.0 ETT secured. The patient was ventilated mechanically throughout the procedure.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter standard pre-procedure checks and a surgical time-out, a flexible adult bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The vocal cords and proximal trachea were normal. The main carina was sharp with mild external impression posteriorly. No intraluminal tumor was seen in either mainstem bronchus. Segmental bronchi in both lungs were free of obstructing lesions.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 22-gauge Wang TBNA needle was advanced through the bronchoscope working channel. Using anatomic landmarks only (no EBUS system available in the OR), the subcarinal (station 7) lymph node was targeted by puncturing the bronchial wall just proximal and slightly posterior to the main carina. Three needle passes were performed with suction. Each pass yielded blood-tinged material with visible tissue cores.\n\nROSE: On-site cytology was available. Rapid evaluation demonstrated cellular samples with lymphocytes and malignant epithelial cells compatible with metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma.

Topical 1% lidocaine to nasopharynx, vocal cords, and trachea. The patient breathed spontaneously via native airway with supplemental oxygen.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter informed consent and a procedural time-out, a flexible adult bronchoscope was introduced orally. The upper airway, vocal cords, and trachea were normal. The main carina was sharp. The right bronchial tree was normal. On the left, there was mild extrinsic impression on the distal left mainstem corresponding to the paratracheal lymph node but no mucosal lesion.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 21-gauge Wang TBNA needle was advanced through the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks without EBUS guidance, the left lower paratracheal (station 4L) lymph node was targeted via the medial wall of the distal trachea just above the left mainstem origin. Four needle passes were performed with suction. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with small whitish tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: Cytotechnologist present for on-site evaluation. ROSE demonstrated abundant benign lymphocytes with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomas. No malignant cells were seen. Adequacy was confirmed after the second pass; two additional passes were obtained for culture and cell block.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4L conventional TBNA x4 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, AFB/fungal cultures, and flow cytometry.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding, hypoxia, or hemodynamic instability.

Anesthesiology provided induction with propofol and rocuronium; patient mechanically ventilated throughout.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter pre-procedural verification and a time-out, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea and main carina were normal. The right bronchial tree was normal. On the left, there was subtle extrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea just above the carina and mild impression on the proximal left mainstem bronchus; mucosa was intact.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 22-gauge Wang TBNA needle was introduced via the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks (no EBUS available in this OR), the left lower paratracheal (4L) node was sampled by puncturing the medial wall of the distal trachea above the left mainstem origin. Three passes were performed with suction. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: Rapid on-site cytology was available. ROSE revealed lymphoid tissue with atypical epithelial cells; findings were suspicious for metastatic carcinoma and deemed adequate for diagnosis. Additional material was set aside for cell block and immunohistochemistry.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4L conventional TBNA x3 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, and immunohistochemical staining.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding, airway compromise, or hemodynamic instability. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigational bronchoscopy was performed; this was purely a blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was extubated in the OR and transferred to PACU in stable condition.

Topical lidocaine applied to upper airway. The patient breathed spontaneously via native airway with supplemental oxygen.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter time-out and confirmation of consent, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced orally. The larynx and trachea were normal. The main carina was sharp. The right mainstem bronchus showed mild external impression along its medial wall consistent with the known 4R node; mucosa was intact. The remainder of the bronchial tree was free of obstructing lesions.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 21-gauge Wang TBNA needle was introduced through the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks (no EBUS), the right lower paratracheal (station 4R) node was targeted from the distal trachea and proximal right mainstem bronchus. Three passes were made with suction applied. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with visible tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: On-site cytology was available. ROSE demonstrated malignant epithelial cells compatible with non-small cell lung carcinoma in a lymphoid background, confirming adequacy after the second pass. A third pass was obtained for cell block.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4R conventional TBNA x3 passes submitted for cytology and cell block with reflex molecular studies.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Minimal self-limited bleeding from the puncture site; no hypoxia or arrhythmia. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigation was performed; this was conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient recovered uneventfully in the bronchoscopy recovery area and was discharged home.

Anesthesiology provided induction with propofol and rocuronium; patient mechanically ventilated throughout.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nFollowing a formal time-out, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea and main carina appeared normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed minimal extrinsic impression along its medial wall. No endobronchial tumor or secretions were seen in either lung.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 22-gauge Wang TBNA needle was passed through the bronchoscope working channel. Under anatomic landmark guidance only (no EBUS system used), the right lower paratracheal (4R) node was sampled via the distal trachea and proximal right mainstem bronchus. Four aspiration passes were performed with suction. All passes yielded blood-tinged material with tissue fragments adequate for cytology and cell block.\n\nROSE: Rapid on-site evaluation by cytology demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in a lymphoid background, confirming N2 involvement. Adequacy was established after the second pass; additional passes were dedicated to cell block and molecular testing.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4R conventional TBNA x4 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, immunohistochemistry, and molecular profiling.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding or hypoxia. No linear EBUS, radial probe, or navigation was used; this was conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was extubated in the OR and transferred to PACU in stable condition. Results will be reviewed with thoracic surgery and medical oncology; given confirmed N2 disease, multimodality therapy rather than primary surgery is anticipated.", "entities": [{"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 133, "end": 154, "text": "Flexible bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 160, "end": 205, "text": "conventional transbronchial needle aspiration"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 207, "end": 211, "text": "TBNA"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 216, "end": 251, "text": "right lower paratracheal lymph node"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 232, "end": 239, "text": "trachea"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 253, "end": 263, "text": "station 4R"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 271, "end": 282, "text": "Wang needle"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 316, "end": 340, "text": "right lower paratracheal"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 342, "end": 344, "text": "4R"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 381, "end": 397, "text": "right upper lobe"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 398, "end": 412, "text": "adenocarcinoma"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 564, "end": 572, "text": "propofol"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 577, "end": 587, "text": "rocuronium"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 688, "end": 709, "text": "flexible bronchoscope"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 770, "end": 781, "text": "main carina"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 803, "end": 826, "text": "right mainstem bronchus"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 985, "end": 1010, "text": "22-gauge Wang TBNA needle"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1129, "end": 1163, "text": "right lower paratracheal (4R) node"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1184, "end": 1198, "text": "distal trachea"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1203, "end": 1235, "text": "proximal right mainstem bronchus"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1237, "end": 1259, "text": "Four aspiration passes"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 1447, "end": 1472, "text": "metastatic adenocarcinoma"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1656, "end": 1666, "text": "Station 4R"}]}

Oxygen sats dropping to high 80s. Already intubated by ICU team with 8.0 ETT.\nRUSHED TO BEDSIDE\nArrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.\nSCOPE FINDINGS:\nETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.\nRIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal\nLEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.\nINITIAL MEASURES:\n\nIced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope\nSome temporary improvement but bleeding continues\nEpi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect\nTranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction\n\nBALLOON TAMPONADE:\nBlood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.\nKept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.\nSecond deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.\nFINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:\nAfter tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.\nSPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)\nPLAN:\n\nICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)\nKeep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning\nReverse any coagulopathy (check labs)\nCTA chest to id[REDACTED] bleeding vessel\nIR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am\nI'll be on standby if rebleeds before IR\nIf rebleeds: will place endobronchial blocker to LUL for longer-term isolation\n\nUPDATE 03:45AM: Patient stable, no further bleeding currently.

{"id": "1970412", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], Susan Rodriguez, a 46-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Jason Park assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 30.4 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 13.0. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 46 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 15.3 millimeters in short axis and 24.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 23.0 millimeters in short axis and 31.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 15.0 millimeters in short axis and 25.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:49, for a total procedure time of 79 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nLisa Thompson, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology", "entities": [{"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 194, "end": 225, "text": "endobronchial ultrasound-guided"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 250, "end": 270, "text": "robotic bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 276, "end": 298, "text": "peripheral lung biopsy"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 425, "end": 436, "text": "lung nodule"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 453, "end": 480, "text": "mediastinal lymphadenopathy"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 530, "end": 545, "text": "30.4 millimeter"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 552, "end": 568, "text": "pulmonary nodule"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 584, "end": 592, "text": "RML lobe"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 618, "end": 638, "text": "lateral (B4) segment"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1300, "end": 1314, "text": "8.0 millimeter"}, {"label": "CTX_TIME", "start": 1361, "end": 1366, "text": "09:30"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1466, "end": 1497, "text": "linear endobronchial ultrasound"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 1753, "end": 1763, "text": "station 2R"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1819, "end": 1835, "text": "15.3 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1854, "end": 1870, "text": "24.4 millimeters"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1928, "end": 1943, "text": "22-gauge needle"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1945, "end": 1964, "text": "3 aspiration passes"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2054, "end": 2065, "text": "lymphocytes"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 2070, "end": 2081, "text": "station 11R"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2137, "end": 2153, "text": "23.0 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2172, "end": 2188, "text": "31.5 millimeters"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2247, "end": 2262, "text": "22-gauge needle"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2264, "end": 2283, "text": "3 aspiration passes"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2373, "end": 2384, "text": "lymphocytes"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2386, "end": 2399, "text": "no malignancy"}, {"label": "ANAT_LN_STATION", "start": 2404, "end": 2414, "text": "station 4R"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2470, "end": 2486, "text": "15.0 millimeters"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2505, "end": 2521, "text": "25.3 millimeters"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2584, "end": 2599, "text": "22-gauge needle"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2601, "end": 2620, "text": "3 aspiration passes"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2701, "end": 2722, "text": "malignant -

{"id": "2025-IP-9847", "text": "PATIENT NAME: [REDACTED]\nMEDICAL RECORD [REDACTED]: 2025-IP-9847\nDATE OF BIRTH: [REDACTED] (Age 70 years)\nPROCEDURE DATE: [REDACTED]\nINSTITUTION: [REDACTED]\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Kevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nFELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)\nANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nLeft lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on [REDACTED] yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative\n\nOPERATION PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule\n\nCLINICAL SCENARIO:\nPatient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nAfter obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. \n\nGeneral anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. \n\nOlympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:\n- Normal supraglottic structures\n- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia\n- Carina: sharp, mobile\n- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy\n- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from [REDACTED] with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment id[REDACTED] at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.\n\nRegistration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). \n\nSteerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.\n\nRadial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.\n\nFluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).\n\nCryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:\n\nCycle 1: \n- Freeze time: 6 minutes\n- Temperature at probe tip: -165°C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20°C)\n\nCycle 2:\n- Freeze time: 6 minutes  \n- Temperature: -167°C\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes\n\nCycle 3:\n- Freeze time: 5 minutes\n- Temperature: -163°C\n- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)\n\nThroughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.\n\nPost-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.\n\nCryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:\n- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)\n- No hemorrhage\n- No airway perforation\n- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)\n\nComplete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. \n\nBronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target\n2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)\n3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS\n4. No procedural complications\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\n\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nDRAINS/TUBES: None placed\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring\n2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry\n3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications\n4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging\n5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain\n6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)\n7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen\n8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake\n9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated\n10. Diet as tolerated\n11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)\n\nFOLLOW-UP PLAN:\n- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course\n- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray\n- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)\n- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation\n- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually\n\nDISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:\nExtensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.\n\nTotal procedure time: 94 minutes\nFluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes  \nRadiation dose: 287 mGy-cm²\n\nATTESTATION: I was present for and personally performed the key components of this procedure including navigation, targeting, ablation, and post-procedure assessment.\n\n___________________________________________\nKevin Zhang,

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions id[REDACTED]. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPCV\t10\t287\t8\t80\t8\t16\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 2.2mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the RML. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB4) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Lateral Segment of RML.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Concentric. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 19G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 5 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 7 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Lymphocytes and benign cells, adequate for evaluation\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nWilliams, MD", "entities": [{"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 148, "end": 164, "text": "pulmonary nodule"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 200, "end": 204, "text": "33mm"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 205, "end": 211, "text": "nodule"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 215, "end": 218, "text": "RML"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 454, "end": 461, "text": "trachea"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 494, "end": 500, "text": "carina"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 602, "end": 612, "text": "secretions"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 828, "end": 847, "text": "anterior chest wall"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 853, "end": 860, "text": "Monarch"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 861, "end": 868, "text": "robotic"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 869, "end": 878, "text": "endoscope"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1073, "end": 1084, "text": "main carina"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1086, "end": 1117, "text": "right and left mainstem bronchi"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 1123, "end": 1136, "text": "lobar carinas"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1224, "end": 1227, "text": "RML"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1307, "end": 1310, "text": "RB4"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1444, "end": 1459, "text": "Lateral Segment"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1463, "end": 1466, "text": "RML"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1469, "end": 1480, "text": "Radial EBUS"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1528, "end": 1538, "text": "Concentric"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1654, "end": 1660, "text": "needle"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1798, "end": 1830, "text": "Transbronchial needle aspiration"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1846, "end": 1849, "text": "19G"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1850, "end": 1867, "text": "aspiration needle"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1896, "end": 1908, "text": "fluoroscopic"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1919, "end": 1927, "text": "5 passes"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1982, "end": 2011, "text": "Transbronchial forceps biopsy"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1997, "end": 2004, "text": "forceps"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 2073, "end": 2084, "text": "7 specimens"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2197, "end": 2215, "text": "cytology brushings"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2294, "end": 2305, "text": "Lymphocytes"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2310, "end": 2322, "text": "benign cells"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2484, "end": 2498, "text": "robotic system"}]}

Biopsy complicated by significant hemorrhage with hemothorax development requiring chest tube placement. Patient transferred to ICU overnight. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nMODIFIED INDICATION: \nGiven active bleeding from biopsy site and confirmed malignancy, multidisciplinary discussion between interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Decision made for bronchoscopic approach to: (1) achieve hemostasis and (2) treat tumor definitively with ablation given high surgical risk and desire to avoid repeat intervention.\n\n**EMERGENT BRONCHOSCOPY WITH RFA - MODIFIED PROTOCOL**\n\nPatient [REDACTED] chest tube in place (right pigtail, 14Fr). Active output decreased but persistent blood-tinged drainage 50mL/hr. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2 after transfusion.\n\nPROCEDURE (Performed [REDACTED], 0800hrs):\nGeneral anesthesia, intubation. Bronchoscopy showed blood in RUL but no active endobronchial source. ENB navigation to RUL posterior segment biopsy site/tumor location. Immediate goal: hemostasis. Secondary goal: tumor ablation.\n\nRFA probe (VIVANT, 1.5cm tip) placed at hemorrhage site within tumor. Treatment modified from standard protocol:\n- Initial lower power (40W x 3min) for cauterization/hemostasis\n- Then standard ablation (90°C x 8min) for tumor treatment\n- Careful monitoring for increased bleeding during treatment\n\nOUTCOME: \nSuccessfully achieved hemostasis - no further bleeding noted post-ablation. Tumor ablation completed per protocol. Chest tube output decreased to <10mL/hr serosanguinous fluid immediately post-procedure.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None additional\n\nMODIFIED PLAN:\n- ICU monitoring continues\n- Chest tube remains, anticipate removal tomorrow if output <50mL/24hr\n- CT chest at 48hr  \n- Standard post-ablation follow-up once acute issues resolved\n\n**UNUSUAL CASE DISCUSSION:**\nThis represents off-label use of bronchoscopic RFA for both hemostasis and tumor treatment following complicated transthoracic biopsy. While not standard indication, multidisciplinary team felt this was best approach to manage both bleeding and provide definitive treatment in one procedure.

Biopsy complicated by significant hemorrhage with hemothorax development requiring chest tube placement. Patient transferred to ICU overnight. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nMODIFIED INDICATION: \nGiven active bleeding from biopsy site and confirmed malignancy, multidisciplinary discussion between interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Decision made for bronchoscopic approach to: (1) achieve hemostasis and (2) treat tumor definitively with ablation given high surgical risk and desire to avoid repeat intervention.\n\n**EMERGENT BRONCHOSCOPY WITH RFA - MODIFIED PROTOCOL**\n\nPatient [REDACTED] chest tube in place (right pigtail, 14Fr). Active output decreased but persistent blood-tinged drainage 50mL/hr. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2 after transfusion.\n\nPROCEDURE (Performed [REDACTED], 0800hrs):\nGeneral anesthesia, intubation. Bronchoscopy showed blood in RUL but no active endobronchial source. ENB navigation to RUL posterior segment biopsy site/tumor location. Immediate goal: hemostasis. Secondary goal: tumor ablation.\n\nRFA probe (VIVANT, 1.5cm tip) placed at hemorrhage site within tumor. Treatment modified from standard protocol:\n- Initial lower power (40W x 3min) for cauterization/hemostasis\n- Then standard ablation (90°C x 8min) for tumor treatment\n- Careful monitoring for increased bleeding during treatment\n\nOUTCOME: \nSuccessfully achieved hemostasis - no further bleeding noted post-ablation. Tumor ablation completed per protocol. Chest tube output decreased to <10mL/hr serosanguinous fluid immediately post-procedure.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None additional\n\nMODIFIED PLAN:\n- ICU monitoring continues\n- Chest tube remains, anticipate removal tomorrow if output <50mL/24hr\n- CT chest at 48hr  \n- Standard post-ablation follow-up once acute issues resolved\n\n**UNUSUAL CASE DISCUSSION:**\nThis represents off-label use of bronchoscopic RFA for both hemostasis and tumor treatment following complicated transthoracic biopsy. While not standard indication, multidisciplinary team felt this was best approach to manage both bleeding and provide definitive treatment in one procedure.

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Carina, Left Carina (LC2), Right Mainstem, Left Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, RUL Carina (RC1), Trachea (Distal 1/3) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPCV\t14\t325\t11\t80\t5\t16\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 2.4mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3). Target lesion is approximately 27mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 0.6cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 8 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3). Instilled 40cc of NS, suction returned with 12cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Granulomatous inflammation\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nRodriguez, MD", "entities": [{"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 154, "end": 155, "text": "5"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 181, "end": 187, "text": "nodule"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 218, "end": 222, "text": "27mm"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 223, "end": 229, "text": "nodule"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 233, "end": 236, "text": "RUL"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 439, "end": 446, "text": "trachea"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 538, "end": 544, "text": "carina"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 737, "end": 747, "text": "aspiration"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 779, "end": 785, "text": "Carina"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 787, "end": 798, "text": "Left Carina"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 800, "end": 803, "text": "LC2"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 806, "end": 820, "text": "Right Mainstem"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 822, "end": 835, "text": "Left Mainstem"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 837, "end": 857, "text": "Bronchus Intermedius"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 859, "end": 869, "text": "RUL Carina"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 859, "end": 862, "text": "RUL"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 871, "end": 874, "text": "RC1"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 877, "end": 884, "text": "Trachea"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1020, "end": 1030, "text": "navigation"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1091, "end": 1098, "text": "robotic"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1099, "end": 1111, "text": "bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1198, "end": 1199, "text": "8"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1207, "end": 1214, "text": "Robotic"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1258, "end": 1261, "text": "Ion"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1330, "end": 1333, "text": "Ion"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1334, "end": 1341, "text": "robotic"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1374, "end": 1390, "text": "Anterior Segment"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1394, "end": 1397, "text": "RUL"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 1399, "end": 1402, "text": "RB3"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1436, "end": 1440, "text": "27mm"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1486, "end": 1489, "text": "Ion"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1490, "end": 1497, "text": "robotic"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1560, "end": 1571, "text": "Radial EBUS"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1614, "end": 1619, "text": "rEBUS"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1626, "end": 1635, "text": "Eccentric"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1700, "end": 1712, "text": "Cone Beam CT"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1794, "end": 1803, "text": "Cios Spin"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1928, "end": 1931, "text": "Ion"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2050, "end": 2053, "text": "Ion"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2169, "end": 2172, "text": "Ion"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2256, "end": 2262, "text": "biopsy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2359, "end": 2391, "text": "Transbronchial needle aspiration"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2411, "end": 2414, "text": "21G"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 2419, "end": 2422, "text": "23G"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2552, "end": 2577, "text": "Transbronchial cryobiopsy"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 2597, "end": 2602, "text": "1.1mm"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 2603, "end": 2612, "text": "cryoprobe"}, {"label": "MEAS_TIME", "start": 2671, "end": 2680, "text": "5 seconds"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2752, "end": 2774, "text": "Bronchoalveolar lavage"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 2792, "end": 2808, "text": "Anterior Segment"}, {"label": "ANAT_LUNG_LOC", "start": 2817, "end": 2820, "text": "RB3"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 2833, "end": 2837, "text": "40cc"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 2867, "end": 2871, "text": "12cc"}, {"label": "OBS_ROSE", "start": 2974, "end": 3000, "text": "Granulomatous inflammation"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 3054, "end": 3077, "text": "No significant bleeding"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 3147, "end": 3163, "text": "no complications"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 3207, "end": 3238, "text": "without immediate complications"}]}

Rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy with destruction of endobronchial tumor.\n2. Flexible bronchoscopy.\n3. Tracheal silicone stent placement.\n\nSURGEON: Laura Bennett, MD (Interventional Pulmonology)\nASSISTANT: Andrew Park, MD (Thoracic Surgery Fellow)\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy and jet ventilation.\n\nINDICATION:\n73-year-old male with known squamous cell carcinoma of the mid-trachea, presenting with stridor and 80% luminal obstruction on CT and bronchoscopy. Planned rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy with debulking and airway stent placement for palliation and airway stabilization.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, a rigid tracheobronchoscope was introduced under direct visualization. Tumor causing near circumferential narrowing of the mid-trachea over ~3 cm was id[REDACTED].\n\nTumor Debulking:\nMechanical debulking was performed using the bevel of the rigid scope and large forceps to core out the intraluminal mass. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) at 35 W and 1.5 L/min flow was then applied circumferentially to residual tumor and bleeding points until a widely patent lumen was obtained. Approximate residual obstruction was < 20% with smooth mucosal surface.\n\nStent Placement:\nA 16 x 50 mm straight silicone Dumon stent was selected. Under direct bronchoscopic visualization, the stent was mounted on the rigid stent loader and deployed across the involved segment. Final position covered the entire tumor bed with adequate proximal and distal margins. The stent was well seated with no migration and good distal ventilation.\n\nThe airway was reinspected distally with a flexible bronchoscope through the rigid barrel. No additional endobronchial disease was id[REDACTED]. Secretions were suctioned.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nTotal estimated blood loss ~20 mL. No significant hypoxia, arrhythmia, or airway perforation. No intraoperative complications.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nThe rigid scope was removed and the patient was transitioned back to a standard ETT and subsequently extubated in the OR. He was transported to PACU on 4 L/min nasal cannula in stable condition. Follow-up CT and bronchoscopy are planned in 4–6 weeks.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nSuccessful rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy with tumor destruction and silicone tracheal stent placement for malignant tracheal obstruction, with marked improvement in airway patency.", "entities": [{"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 133, "end": 145, "text": "mid-tracheal"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 133, "end": 144, "text": "mid-trachea"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 146, "end": 157, "text": "obstruction"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 163, "end": 186, "text": "squamous cell carcinoma"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 234, "end": 264, "text": "Rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 270, "end": 281, "text": "destruction"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 285, "end": 304, "text": "endobronchial tumor"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 309, "end": 330, "text": "Flexible bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 335, "end": 343, "text": "Tracheal"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL", "start": 344, "end": 352, "text": "silicone"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 353, "end": 358, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 359, "end": 368, "text": "placement"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 516, "end": 534, "text": "rigid bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 539, "end": 554, "text": "jet ventilation"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 597, "end": 620, "text": "squamous cell carcinoma"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 628, "end": 639, "text": "mid-trachea"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 657, "end": 664, "text": "stridor"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_PRE", "start": 669, "end": 672, "text": "80%"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 673, "end": 692, "text": "luminal obstruction"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 725, "end": 755, "text": "rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 761, "end": 770, "text": "debulking"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 782, "end": 787, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 900, "end": 925, "text": "rigid tracheobronchoscope"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 969, "end": 974, "text": "Tumor"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1039, "end": 1043, "text": "3 cm"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1080, "end": 1100, "text": "Mechanical debulking"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1138, "end": 1149, "text": "rigid scope"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1160, "end": 1167, "text": "forceps"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1184, "end": 1201, "text": "intraluminal mass"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1203, "end": 1227, "text": "Argon plasma coagulation"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1229, "end": 1232, "text": "APC"}, {"label": "MEAS_ENERGY", "start": 1237, "end": 1241, "text": "35 W"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1299, "end": 1313, "text": "residual tumor"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST", "start": 1342, "end": 1361, "text": "widely patent lumen"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST", "start": 1413, "end": 1418, "text": "< 20%"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT_SIZE", "start": 1468, "end": 1478, "text": "16 x 50 mm"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL", "start": 1488, "end": 1496, "text": "silicone"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL", "start": 1497, "end": 1502, "text": "Dumon"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1503, "end": 1508, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT", "start": 1600, "end": 1605, "text": "stent"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1859, "end": 1880, "text": "flexible bronchoscope"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1893, "end": 1905, "text": "rigid barrel"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1921, "end": 1942, "text": "endobronchial disease"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1961, "end": 1971, "text": "Secretions"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 2032, "end": 2037, "text": "20 mL"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2039, "end": 2061, "text": "No significant hypoxia"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2063, "end": 2073, "text": "arrhythmia"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2078, "end": 2096, "text": "airway perforation"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 2149, "end": 2160, "text": "rigid scope"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 2420, "end": 2450, "text": "rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2456, "end": 2473, "text": "tumor destruction"}, {"label": "DEV_STENT_MATERIAL", "start": 2478, "end": 2486, "text": "silicone"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 2516, "end": 2546, "text": "malignant tracheal obstruction"}, {"label": "ANAT_AIRWAY", "start": 2526, "end": 2534, "text": "tracheal"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_AIRWAY_LUMEN_POST", "start": 2553, "end": 2589, "text": "marked improvement in airway patency"}]}

Ultrasound reveals complex septated effusion. Bedside thoracentesis for diagnosis followed by chest tube for continued drainage.\n\nULTRASOUND-GUIDED THORACENTESIS:\nThe patient was positioned sitting upright. Right posterolateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound id[REDACTED] a moderate, complex right pleural effusion with diaphragmatic excursion and no obvious lung entrapment. A safe window in the right posterior axillary line at the 8th intercostal space was chosen.\n\nLocal anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was infiltrated down to the pleura. A 19G needle with catheter was advanced above the rib under real-time ultrasound guidance into the pleural space with return of turbid, yellow fluid. Approximately 40 mL of fluid was aspirated for diagnostic studies (chemistry, cell count, Gram stain/culture, cytology, pH, LDH, glucose).\n\nCHEST TUBE INSERTION:\nGiven the thick, loculated nature of the effusion and sepsis, a decision was made to place a large-bore chest tube. A 28 Fr straight chest tube was inserted via a separate incision at the mid-axillary line in the 6th intercostal space using blunt dissection and Seldinger technique into the posterolateral collection. The tube was secured with sutures and connected to -20 cm H2O suction.\n\nInitial drainage was approximately 900 mL of turbid, malodorous fluid. The patient tolerated the procedure without hypotension or significant desaturation. Post-procedure ultrasound confirmed lung expansion, and a CXR was ordered to confirm position and evaluate for complications.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNo immediate pneumothorax, bleeding, or organ injury was observed.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nPatient [REDACTED] the ICU on existing vasopressor and ventilator settings.

Shared decision-making favored tunneled indwelling pleural catheter placement for symptom control and outpatient management.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nPre-procedure ultrasound confirmed a large free-flowing right pleural effusion with no significant loculations. Patient was positioned supine with head of bed elevated.\n\nAfter time-out, the right lateral chest wall was prepped and draped. Local anesthesia was obtained with 1% lidocaine at the planned entry and exit sites. Under real-time ultrasound guidance, an 18G finder needle was advanced into the pleural space at the right mid-axillary line, 6th intercostal space, with return of serosanguinous fluid.\n\nA guidewire was advanced and serial dilation performed. A subcutaneous tunnel approximately 7 cm in length was created anteriorly, and the PleurX catheter was pulled through the tunnel exiting at the anterior chest wall. The peel-away sheath was then advanced into the pleural space over the guidewire, and the catheter was inserted and the sheath removed.\n\nThe catheter was connected to a vacuum drainage bottle; approximately 1,500 mL of serosanguinous fluid was drained slowly with monitoring for chest discomfort and blood pressure changes. The catheter tip position was confirmed by ultrasound. The exit site and entry site were secured with sutures and sterile dressings.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNo significant pain, hypotension, or re-expansion pulmonary edema occurred. No immediate bleeding or air leak was noted.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nThe patient was discharged home the same day with home health nursing arranged for drainage three times per week and instructions for signs of infection or catheter malfunction.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nTechnically successful ultrasound-guided placement of a tunneled right PleurX catheter with large-volume drainage of recurrent malignant

Skin was marked in the mid-axillary line at the level of the 7th intercostal space.\n\nAfter sterile prep and drape, local anesthesia was obtained with 1% lidocaine. Under real-time ultrasound guidance, an 18G needle was advanced into the collection with return of blood-tinged serous fluid. A 0.035\" guidewire was passed and the tract was dilated.\n\nA 12 Fr pigtail catheter was advanced over the wire into the pleural space and the pigtail was formed. The catheter was attached to a closed drainage system and secured with suture and anchoring device.\n\nApproximately 700 mL of serosanguinous fluid drained during the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNo evidence of pneumothorax or bleeding on immediate post-procedure ultrasound. Estimated blood loss < 10 mL.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nPatient [REDACTED] the oncology floor with the catheter to continuous drainage and plan for daily monitoring of output and consideration of talc slurry pleurodesis if lung remains expandable.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nSuccessful ultrasound-guided placement of a right pleural pigtail catheter (12 Fr) for ongoing drainage of malignant effusion.", "entities": [{"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 155, "end": 164, "text": "Loculated"}, {"label": "LATERALITY", "start": 165, "end": 170, "text": "right"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 171, "end": 197, "text": "malignant pleural effusion"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 281, "end": 298, "text": "Ultrasound-guided"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 299, "end": 308, "text": "placement"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 312, "end": 348, "text": "small-bore pleural drainage catheter"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 350, "end": 357, "text": "pigtail"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 363, "end": 381, "text": "malignant effusion"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 513, "end": 522, "text": "recurrent"}, {"label": "LATERALITY", "start": 523, "end": 528, "text": "right"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 529, "end": 545, "text": "pleural effusion"}, {"label": "CTX_HISTORICAL", "start": 547, "end": 566, "text": "Prior thoracenteses"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 602, "end": 612, "text": "ultrasound"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 626, "end": 635, "text": "loculated"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 636, "end": 647, "text": "collections"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 636, "end": 646, "text": "collection"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 658, "end": 683, "text": "posterolateral chest wall"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 710, "end": 737, "text": "small-bore pigtail catheter"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 721, "end": 737, "text": "pigtail catheter"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 857, "end": 867, "text": "ultrasound"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 891, "end": 905, "text": "posterolateral"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 906, "end": 918, "text": "fluid pocket"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 927, "end": 940, "text": "diaphragmatic"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1021, "end": 1042, "text": "7th intercostal space"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 1110, "end": 1122, "text": "1% lidocaine"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1140, "end": 1159, "text": "ultrasound guidance"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1140, "end": 1150, "text": "ultrasound"}, {"label": "DEV_NEEDLE", "start": 1164, "end": 1174, "text": "18G needle"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1223, "end": 1248, "text": "blood-tinged serous fluid"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1259, "end": 1268, "text": "guidewire"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER_SIZE", "start": 1310, "end": 1315, "text": "12 Fr"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 1316, "end": 1332, "text": "pigtail catheter"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1369, "end": 1382, "text": "pleural space"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 1526, "end": 1532, "text": "700 mL"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1536, "end": 1556, "text": "serosanguinous fluid"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 1645, "end": 1672, "text": "No evidence of pneumothorax"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 1676, "end": 1684, "text": "bleeding"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 1748, "end": 1753, "text": "10 mL"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 1985, "end": 2002, "text": "ultrasound-guided"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2003, "end": 2012, "text": "placement"}, {"label": "LATERALITY", "start": 2018, "end": 2023, "text": "right"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 2024, "end": 2031, "text": "pleural"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER_SIZE", "start": 2050, "end": 2055, "text": "12 Fr"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 2081, "end": 2099, "text": "malignant effusion"}]}

PET shows moderate uptake in both sites. Combined nodal and parenchymal sampling requested.\n\nPROCEDURE SUMMARY:\nUnder general anesthesia via ETT, a flexible bronchoscope was passed to the segmental bronchi. No endobronchial tumor was seen.\n\nEBUS-TBNA (station 7):\nA convex EBUS scope was used to sample a 1.4 cm subcarinal node. Three passes were performed with a 22G needle. ROSE was adequate with benign-appearing lymphocytes.\n\nEM NAVIGATION + TBLB (LLL superior segment):\nAn EM navigation system was used to register the pre-procedure CT. The lesion in the LLL superior segment was targeted; registration error ~3 mm. The scope was advanced to the LLL superior segment, and navigation confirmed proximity to the lesion. Fluoroscopy confirmed the biopsy forceps at the lesion margin. Four transbronchial biopsies were obtained; specimens were sent for histology and molecular studies.\n\nNo significant bleeding or hypoxia occurred. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nCombined EM-navigated transbronchial biopsies of LLL lesion and single-station EBUS-TBNA of station 7 for staging.", "entities": []}

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions id[REDACTED]. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t11\t302\t16\t80\t8\t21\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 4.0mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the RUL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB2) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Posterior Segment of RUL.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Concentric. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 5 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 8 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage performed at RB2. 40mL NS instilled with 17mL return.

{"id": "95-847-2631", "text": "PATIENT [REDACTED]: Thompson, David W. | MRN: [REDACTED] | DOB: [REDACTED]\nPROCEDURE DATE: [REDACTED]\nLOCATION: [REDACTED]\nPROCEDURALIST: Elizabeth Morrison, MD, PhD, FCCP, DABIP\nASSISTANT: Jennifer Lee, DO (IP Fellow, PGY-6)\nANESTHESIOLOGIST: Robert Chang, MD, MBA\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nRight lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule, segment RB9, measuring 2.7 x 2.4 cm on most recent CT imaging dated [REDACTED], with associated spiculation and pleural tethering highly concerning for malignancy. Previous transthoracic needle biopsy performed on [REDACTED] yielded diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 positive, confirming primary lung origin.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: As above\n\nPROCEDURE(S) PERFORMED:\n1. Flexible bronchoscopy with complete airway survey\n2. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with real-time cone-beam CT guidance\n3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmation of target lesion\n4. Radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe peripheral nodule\n5. Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:\nThis is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.\n\nDETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:\nFollowing standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.\n\nAnesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.\n\nOlympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from [REDACTED] loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) id[REDACTED] and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.\n\nNavigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.\n\nCone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.\n\nExtended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90°C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation with vital signs: HR 72-85, BP 132/78 - 145/82, SpO2 98-100% on FiO2 0.6. End-tidal CO2 maintained 35-38 mmHg.\n\nAfter completion of initial 8-minute cycle, probe repositioned 5mm posterior to treat overlapping zone and ensure complete ablation coverage of entire tumor volume plus 5mm margin. Second ablation cycle performed: 6 minutes, target temperature 90°C. Impedance monitoring again demonstrated appropriate curve. Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic changes throughout entire tumor volume consistent with coagulative necrosis. Ice-cream cone appearance of ablation zone well visualized extending beyond original tumor margins.\n\nGuide sheath and EWC slowly withdrawn under direct bronchoscopic visualization. Careful inspection of airways performed showing mild mucosal hyperemia at catheter contact points but no evidence of perforation, significant edema, or active hemorrhage. Small amount of serosanguinous secretions suctioned from right lower lobe, estimated <10 mL total.\n\nAirways irrigated with normal saline. Bronchoscope withdrawn and patient emerged from general anesthesia without complications. Following standard reversal and spontaneous ventilation recovery, patient successfully extubated with good cough and gag reflexes. Transferred to post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition with oxygen saturation 94% on 2L NC.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal, less than 15 milliliters\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS ADMINISTERED: 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution\nSPECIMENS SENT: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RLL lateral basal segment target lesion\n2. Radiofrequency ablation completed per protocol with two overlapping ablation zones\n3. Good real-time monitoring throughout with appropriate impedance and temperature curves\n4. Post-ablation imaging demonstrates adequate treatment zone with apparent complete coverage\n5.

Flexible bronchoscopy\n2. Bronchoalveolar lavage\n3. Fluoroscopic-guided transbronchial lung biopsy, right upper lobe\n\nSEDATION: Moderate sedation (Versed 3mg, Fentanyl 75mcg) with topical lidocaine\n\nPROCEDURE NOTE:\nPatient [REDACTED] and bronchoscope introduced via oral route. Airway examination revealed normal vocal cords, patent trachea, and normal-appearing carina. All visible airways were free of endobronchial abnormalities. Mucosa appeared normal throughout.\n\nBAL was performed in the right middle lobe using 150mL sterile saline (3 x 50mL). Approximately 75mL of slightly turbid fluid was recovered and sent for cell count, differential, CD4/CD8 ratio, cultures, and cytology.\n\nFor transbronchial biopsies, the bronchoscope was advanced into the right upper lobe. Using biplanar fluoroscopy (AP and lateral views), the biopsy forceps (standard cup forceps) were advanced into the RUL anterior segment (RB3) and positioned approximately 2cm from the pleural surface. 8 biopsies were obtained from the right upper lobe, targeting areas of perilymphatic nodularity.\n\nEach specimen was placed in formalin and examined visually - multiple fragments appeared adequate in size. Minimal bleeding occurred, controlled with wedge technique. Repeat fluoroscopy at end of procedure showed no pneumothorax.\n\nFLUOROSCOPY DATA:\n- Total fluoro time: 1.8 min\n- DAP: 24 mGy\u00b7cm\u00b2\n\nSPECIMENS:\n1.

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the left lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was id[REDACTED] by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  An 8 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 1600cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had diffuse carcinomatosis with multiple hard white pleural nodules covering the parietal and visceral pleura.  No adhesions were present Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 12 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, the pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly.\nComplications: None\nThe patient tolerated the procedural well.\nPost-procedure chest radiograph showed mild post-procedural subcutaneous air with full lung re-expansion and IPC in place\nEstimated Blood Loss: 15cc\nPost Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion \nRecommendation:\nWill await pathology and microbiological studies\nPatient [REDACTED] pleural catheter draining and will next week for initial drainage.\nJordan Parks, MD \nPulmonology Medicine\nUCLA Medical Center", "entities": [{"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 51, "end": 71, "text": "Medical Thoracoscopy"}, {"label": "PROC_METHOD", "start": 73, "end": 84, "text": "pleuroscopy"}, {"label": "LATERALITY", "start": 155, "end": 160, "text": "Right"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 167, "end": 183, "text": "Pleural effusion"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 601, "end": 607, "text": "placed"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 725, "end": 732, "text": "pleural"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 725, "end": 731, "text": "pleura"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 828, "end": 851, "text": "chlorhexidine gluconate"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 853, "end": 863, "text": "Chloraprep"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 957, "end": 966, "text": "lidocaine"}, {"label": "MEDICATION", "start": 1007, "end": 1016, "text": "lidocaine"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1019, "end": 1025, "text": "1.5 cm"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1068, "end": 1078, "text": "dissection"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1103, "end": 1116, "text": "pleural space"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1103, "end": 1109, "text": "pleura"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1121, "end": 1128, "text": "entered"}, {"label": "MEAS_SIZE", "start": 1134, "end": 1138, "text": "8 mm"}, {"label": "LATERALITY", "start": 1186, "end": 1190, "text": "left"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1203, "end": 1229, "text": "6th anterior axillary line"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1282, "end": 1289, "text": "suction"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1322, "end": 1328, "text": "remove"}, {"label": "SPECIMEN", "start": 1329, "end": 1342, "text": "pleural fluid"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1348, "end": 1355, "text": "removal"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 1373, "end": 1379, "text": "1600cc"}, {"label": "SPECIMEN", "start": 1383, "end": 1403, "text": "serosanguinous fluid"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1415, "end": 1436, "text": "pleuroscopy telescope"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1469, "end": 1475, "text": "trocar"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1498, "end": 1511, "text": "pleural space"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1540, "end": 1554, "text": "carcinomatosis"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 1580, "end": 1595, "text": "pleural nodules"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1609, "end": 1617, "text": "parietal"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1622, "end": 1630, "text": "visceral"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1666, "end": 1674, "text": "Biopsies"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 1704, "end": 1719, "text": "parietal pleura"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1752, "end": 1759, "text": "forceps"}, {"label": "MEAS_COUNT", "start": 1842, "end": 1844, "text": "12"}, {"label": "OBS_FINDING", "start": 1877, "end": 1893, "text": "minimal bleeding"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 1914, "end": 1922, "text": "biopsies"}, {"label": "DEV_INSTRUMENT", "start": 1966, "end": 1987, "text": "pleuroscopy telescope"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER_SIZE", "start": 2011, "end": 2015, "text": "15.5"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 2016, "end": 2032, "text": "pleural catheter"}, {"label": "ANAT_PLEURA", "start": 2053, "end": 2066, "text": "pleural space"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2097, "end": 2106, "text": "tunneling"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_COMPLICATION", "start": 2134, "end": 2138, "text": "None"}, {"label": "OUTCOME_PLEURAL", "start": 2264, "end": 2286, "text": "full lung re-expansion"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 2291, "end": 2294, "text": "IPC"}, {"label": "MEAS_VOL", "start": 2326, "end": 2330, "text": "15cc"}, {"label": "OBS_LESION", "start": 2357, "end": 2373, "text": "Pleural effusion"}, {"label": "DEV_CATHETER", "start": 2459, "end": 2475, "text": "pleural catheter"}, {"label": "PROC_ACTION", "start": 2516, "end": 2524, "text": "drainage"}]}

No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.\n\nDecision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.\nRigid Bronchoscopy Phase:\nPatient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.\nVentilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.\nThe rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.\nMechanical Debridement:\nUsing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.\nEstimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue\nHemostasis Measures:\nAs expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:\n\nIced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.\nTopical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.\nTranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.\n\nAfter approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.\nElectrocautery:\nFlexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.\nTreatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus\nTreatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time\nEffect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis\nArgon Plasma Coagulation:\nAPC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.\nTreatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.\nDuration: 6 minutes active APC time\nResult: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface\nAssessment after debridement:\nRight mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.\nBalloon Dilation:\nBoston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.\nInflation sequence:\n\nFirst inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nSecond inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nThird inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)\n\nFluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.\nPost-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.\nStent Placement:\nAfter discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.\nStent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length\nDeployment technique:\n\nStent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance\nPositioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus\nFluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views\nSlow, controlled deployment under direct visualization\nPost-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion\n\nPost-stent assessment:\nFlexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.\nFindings:\n\nStent well-positioned, no migration\nExcellent apposition to airway walls\nRUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent\nRML orifice: Visible and patent\nRLL orifice: Visible and patent\nAll segments of right lung now visualized for first time\nSignificant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration:\nExtensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:\n\nRight upper lobe: Approximately 30mL\nRight middle lobe: Approximately 20mL\nRight lower lobe: Approximately 40mL\n\nTotal secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.\nFinal Airway Inspection:\n\nTrachea: Normal\nLeft bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent\nRight main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)\nRUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation\nMinimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent\n\nRigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).\nAirway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM\nEstimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL\nSpecimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)\n\nPART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)\nPatient [REDACTED] arms tucked.

CT chest shows near-complete obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus by endobronchial tumor. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to therapeutic bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left mainstem bronchus obstruction secondary to endobronchial tumor\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy, Endobronchial Tumor Destruction (CPT 31641), Mechanical Tumor Debridement (CPT 31640), Airway Stent Placement (CPT 31631)\nATTENDING: Dr. Michael Anderson\nASSISTANT: Dr. Sarah Kim, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Robert Martinez\nRT: Lisa Johnson\nAnesthesia: Dr. Thomas Wright\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA\nMONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line\nINSTRUMENT: Storz rigid bronchoscope (14mm), Olympus flexible bronchoscope, Electrocautery (Bovie), APC probe, mechanical debrider, 14mm x 60mm silicone stent (Dumon)\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT [REDACTED]: Supine with shoulder roll\nA rigid bronchoscope (14mm) was introduced via the mouth under direct visualization. High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) was utilized. A complete airway survey was performed.\nInitial Findings:\n\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nRight mainstem: Patent, mucosa normal\nLeft mainstem: 90% obstructed by friable, hemorrhagic endobronchial tumor starting 1cm distal to the carina and extending 3cm distally\n\nTherapeutic Interventions:\n1. Mechanical Debridement: The tumor was cored using the rigid bronchoscope with mechanical debridement. Multiple passes were required to remove bulk tumor. Estimated tumor volume removed: 15cc.\n2. Electrocautery: Residual tumor base was treated with electrocautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. Total treatment time: 3 minutes. FiO2 maintained at 40% during cautery.\n3. Argon Plasma Coagulation: APC was applied to residual tumor at 40 watts, argon flow 1.5 L/min. Treatment applied circumferentially to tumor base. Duration: 2 minutes.\nResults: Prior to treatment, left mainstem bronchus was 10% patent. After treatment, the airway was 70% patent.\n4. Stent Placement: Due to significant malacia and risk of re-obstruction, a 14mm x 60mm Dumon silicone stent was deployed in the left mainstem bronchus under direct visualization and fluoroscopic guidance. Stent [REDACTED] confirmed endoscopically with good apposition to airway wall.\nHemostasis was confirmed with minimal oozing controlled with topical epinephrine (1:10,000 dilution, 10mL instilled). A flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid barrel for final inspection showing:\n\nPatent stent lumen\nVisible LUL and LLL orifices through stent\nNo significant bleeding\n\nThe bronchoscope and adjunct instruments were withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nEndobronchial tumor debridement (histology)\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. [REDACTED] is a 72-year-old female with squamous cell lung cancer and critical left mainstem obstruction.

{"id": "20578149", "text": "DATE OF PROCEDURE: [REDACTED]\nPatient name: [REDACTED]RN: [REDACTED]\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant central airway obstruction.  \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y- stent placement \nSURGEON: Russell Miller, MD\nINDICATIONS: Airway obstruction\nConsent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient\u2019s family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation) we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and has to convert to a 12mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.  Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.  It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression. Tumor debulking  was performed using APC to  \u201cburn and shave\u201d the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved. \nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position. Post-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery. \n\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\t\n\nMaya Ellington MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nUniversity Medical Center Los
