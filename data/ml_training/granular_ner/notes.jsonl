No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.\nLeft Lung Proximal Airways: Large clot completely obstructing the LMSB - extending to the main carina.\nLUL and LLL also completely obstructed by clot.  After extraction of clot, the LMSB and LLL were otherwise normal in anatomy without endobronchial lesions.\nIncomplete assessment of LUL, as clot was not fully extracted from this area.\nMucosa: Mildly friable.\nSecretions: Thin, blood-tinged.\nAll secretions were suctioned to clear (therapeutic aspiration). \n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, left lower lobe from blood clot and mucus.\nEndobronchial obstruction due to debris/clot was mechanically excised and removed using bland alligator forceps.\nForeign body removal of large endobronchial clot burden, which is not native to the airway, was performed.\nThe was performed using the below modalities:\n-Numerous cold saline flushing to dislodge clot and control any distal bleeding.\n-Therapeutic aspiration utilizing Neptune suction.\n-Bland alligator forceps\n \nAble to remove all clot from the LMSB and majority of LLL and LB7/8-10.\nThis included a large cast of clot that was dislodged and removed from LLL truncus basalis and basilar segments.\nSome partially obstructing clot remained in the LLL superior segment (LB6), which could not be extracted despite extensive time.\nView from mid LMSB with patent LLL bronchus and partially patent LUL bronchus.\nLLL superior segment with residual partially obstructing clot:\n \nThe LUL remained largely filled with clot, although there may be some partial ventilation occurring here based on bubbling/tidaling of clot seen.\nThe  LUL Aspergilloma is the suspsected source of bleed.\nTherefore, LUL clot was intentionally left in place to allow to organize and prevent further bleeding from the LUL.\nClot remaining in LUL. \n \n \nThere was no active bleeding or pooling blood seen.\nIn hopes of preventing recurrence of active bleeding, the following endobronchial medications were instilled:\nEndobronchial epinephrine 0.4mg was instilled into the LUL - targeting LB1/2 and LB3.\nEndobronchial tranexamic acid 1000mg was instilled into the LUL - targeting LB1/2 and LB3.\nA Uniblocker 9Fr was the only bronchial blocker available.  The Uniblocker ventilator adaptor was attached to the tracheostomy tube and the the 9Fr bronchial balloon blocker balloon was guided into the distal LMSB under direct visualization (using parallel Slim disposable scope via the tracheostomy tube).\n-The bronchial blocker balloon was inflated to fully occlude the left mainstem bronchus.\n-Placed at 25-26cm at the dark blue securement device.  Bronchial blocker secured tightly in position using this securement device.\n-Confirmed that 8cc of air was needed to adequately inflate the balloon to fully occlude the LMSB.\nThe endobronchial blocker balloon was then deflated and left in the distal LMSB in case emergently needed for recurrent massive hemoptysis.\nResidual secretions, saline, and minimal blood suctioned to clear.

Ventilator settings, labs, and body habitus adequate for bedside procedure.\nHas slightly high riding innominate artery (though not classic) as well as a large bridging neck vein.\nVV ECMO/DVT/PE anticoagulation held and will restart shortly thereafter. Consent signed.\nDetails of Procedure Performed:  \n \nThe patient remained in the ICU with a previously placed single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nThe patient was positioned supine with a padded shoulder roll in place, the head of bed elevated, and the neck moderately extended.\nA surgical brief was performed and the level of inspired fraction of oxygen was reduced to 40%.\nPatient remained on VV ECMO support. After adequate anesthesia, landmarks were palpated including the thyroid notch, cricoid, and suprasternal notch.\nNeck ultrasound was performed to confirm vascular anatomy. Exposure was excellent.\nThe anterior neck was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. \n \nA surgical time out was performed.\n5mL of 1% lidocaine was injected 2-3 cm above the sternal notch.\nIt was made higher due to the known partially high-riding innominate.\nA 3cm horizontal skin incision was made with a #15 blade knife in a natural, relaxed skin tension line midway between the cricoid cartilage and the sternal notch.\nBovie cautery was used to dissect through the platysma and down to the strap muscles, with effort made to avoid the anterior jugular veins.\nThere were two vertical engorged veins along the midline raphe with a bridging vein between then.\nThe bridging vein was dissected, suture ligated, and divided. This allowed visualization of the midline raphe.\nThe strap muscles were separated vertically at the midline with Bovie cautery. The strap muscles are retracted laterally.\nUsing a combination of blunt and careful cautery midline dissection, the anterior tracheal wall was freed of soft tissue.\nThe innominate artery was identified and protected. There was good soft tissue between the innominate and the trachea which was not disturbed.\nThe trachea was palpated to find the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings.\nThere was adequate distance between the innominate artery and the planned insertion site.\nUnder bronchoscopic guidance, the endotracheal tube cuff was deflated and was pulled back below the level of the vocal cords.\nA finder needle was placed through the anterior trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilaginous rings.\nOnce confirmed by bronchoscopy, a seldinger technique was used to serially dilate the tracheotomy over a wire and to place a # 7 cuffed shiley tracheostomy.\nThe tracheostomy cuff was inflated. Cross table ventilation was performed and the tracheostomy placement was confirmed by bronchoscopy through the tracheostomy as well as CO2 return on the anesthesia monitor.\nThe tracheostomy inner cannula was then placed. Surgicel was placed in the wound bed though hemostasis was great but plan to resume anticoagulation very shortly.\nThe tracheostomy was secured with loose 2-0 prolene sutures to the skin and tracheostomy straps to maintain airway but prevent skin pressure injuries.\nThe endotracheal tube was then withdrawn completely. The tracheostomy obturator was provided to the bedside care team.\nThe patient remained in the ICU in critical condition. There were no complications.\nAt the end of the procedure, I contacted her husband Carl Pinell at 626-991-6311 \n \nEBL: 1ml\n \nFluids: per anesthesia record\n \nSpecimens: none\n \nImplants: none\n \nDrains: none\n \nComplications: none immediately apparent\n \nDisposition: stable, ventilated, remained in ICU, on VV ECMO\n \nPlan: \nOkay to resume bival in 1 hour\nTrach ties to stay for 7-10 days\nNo need for routine trach exchange within first 14 day if not having issues\nDo not over inflate the cuff"}

timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine\n \nInitial Airway Inspection Findings:\n  \nThe laryngeal mask airway is in good position.\nPharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.\nLarynx: Mild edema and erythema\nVocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions\nTrachea: Normal.\nMain Carina: Sharp\nRight Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.\nNo evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.\nLeft Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.\nNo evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.\nMucosa: Friable.\nSecretions: Copious thick and thin, clear to tan secretions/mucus throughout with left > right.\nERYTHEMATOUS AND EDEMATOUS SUPRAGLOTTIC SPACE\n \n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).\nInstilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.\nSamples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n \nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA.\nThe patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the subglottic posterior trachea where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging.\nNo suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspeciton with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope.\nPOSTERIOR MEMBRANE DEFECT\nAdvanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation.\nThe defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum.\nThe scope was subsequently introduced into the esophagus to evaluate for esophageal injury.\nWith Gastroenterology present, the length of the esophagus was examined and no esophageal defect/injury was identified.\nDecision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed.\nThe black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth.\nThe vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them.\nOnce the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed.\nIntubation was easy. \n \n \nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\n \n \t \nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect\t 8 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom \t2.5 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina\t3 cm\n \nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion as described above.\nIntubation was easy. \n \nA silicone Y-stent (16mm x 13mm x 13mm) was initially modified to have tracheal portion cover the defect with short bronchial limbs for migration prevention.\nHowever, significant difficulty was encountered advancing the stent into the deployer, eventually causing a mild tear of a bronchial limb.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular tracheal stent measuring 16mmx 45mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea.\nThe rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place.\n12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 15 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).\nTotal 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.\nSILICONE STENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEDURE \nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\nAt the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\nSPECIMEN(S): \n--LUL BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 91 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway occlusion.\nNo occlusion was identified on bronchoscopic evaluation. Copious mucus/secretions were suctioned from throughout the airways and it is surmised that the occlusion on prior cross-sectional imaging was from mucus impaction.\nThe patient was examined with endobronchial ultrasound but no suspicious lesions were identified and no biopsies were performed.\nOn re-inspection the patient had a posterior membrane defect at the distal trachea.\nA silicone tracheal stent was placed via rigid bronchoscopy to span the defect.\n--Starte stent Hydration Regimen TID in the following order (this has been ordered): \n1) Albuterol nebs\n2) Hypertonic saline (3%) nebs\n3) Flutter valve\n--Guaifenesin 1200mg PO BID\n--Please engage case management to obtain nebulizer and medications (as above) for patient prior to discharge as patient will require this regimen as long as he has stent in place\n--Follow up BAL results\n--Anticipate bronchoscopic re-evaluation of stent in appx 2 weeks"}

Purulent secretions were seen throughout the airways.\nOnce secretions were suctioned inspection of the right sided airways should multiple small endobronchial nodular lesions concerning for airway metastasis.\nOn the left in the mid left mainstem a 1.5cm fistula was seen at the medial aspect of the posterior wall.\nDistally (similar to what was seen on the right) were multiple small endobronchial lesions with an appearance suggestive of malignancy.\nMultiple nodules from the left and right side were biopsied with flexible forceps and placed in formalin.\nAt this point we measured the length of the fistula and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the fistula within the left mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the selected area required to cover the fistula with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient\u2019s chest wall.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 14x30 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed slightly too proximally with the distal edge just covering the fistula.\nWe then decided to place a second 14x40 Aero stent into the previously place stent to better cover the obstruction.\nThis was done in a similar fashion. On inspection after placement the originally placed stent was noted to have been pushed distally by the second stent (more distal than desired and obstructing the orifice of the left upper and lower lobe. We then removed the 14x40 stent by grasping the proximal edge with forceps. The stent could not be retracted through the tracheostomy so the trach tube was removed and then the stent was pulled through the stoma, after which re re-inserted the trach over a bronchoscope and re-attached it to the ventilator. We then retraced the remaining 14x30 mm \nAero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent into proper position (within the left mainstem covering the fistula) with forceps. Once this was done and we were satisfied with the final result the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. We then turned the patient over to anesthesia service to recover and transfer back to the ICU.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer back to ICU\n- Await tissue diagnosis from biopsied endobronchial nodules\n- Obtain post procedure CXR\n- TID saline nebulizers along with ensuring oxygen is humidified to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent."}

{"id": "note_141", "text": "Preoperative Diagnosis:\nNear-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nNear-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia\n\nProcedure Performed:\nRigid bronchoscopy with silicone Y-stent placement\n\nIndication:\nNear-complete tracheal obstruction requiring urgent intervention\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure\n\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure after discussion, in lay terms, of the indications, procedural details, risks, benefits, and alternatives. The patient acknowledged understanding and agreed to proceed.\n\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. Initial airway inspection was performed using an ultra-slim Olympus P190 flexible bronchoscope inserted through the patient\u2019s customized 5.5-mm tracheostomy tube. At the distal margin of the tracheostomy tube, approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina, there was a ridge of granulation tissue occluding approximately 80% of the tracheostomy tube lumen. Distal to this obstruction, there was severe tracheobronchial malacia with near-complete collapse of the distal trachea and right mainstem bronchus, and approximately 75% obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus. The airway mucosa was diffusely erythematous and inflamed.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope and tracheostomy tube were removed, and an attempt was made to insert a 14-mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma; this was unsuccessful due to the small size of the stoma. The tracheostomy tube was reinserted, and rigid bronchoscopy was then attempted via the oral route. However, the patient had severely distorted upper airway anatomy and significant edema, making visualization of the posterior pharynx and vocal cords impossible. Attempts were made to insert progressively smaller rigid bronchoscopes, down to a 6-mm scope, but these were unsuccessful due to a fixed stricture within the tracheostomy tract. At this point, otolaryngology was consulted intraoperatively for assistance with surgical extension of the tracheostomy stoma. Otolaryngology also attempted visualization of the vocal cords using suspension laryngoscopy but was unsuccessful. The tracheostomy stoma was surgically extended; however, due to extensive scar tissue and concern for injury to the anterior trachea, the stoma could not be enlarged sufficiently to accommodate a large rigid bronchoscope. It was, however, extended enough to allow insertion of smaller rigid bronchoscopes. A 6-mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma and advanced to the main carina. Due to the small diameter of the scope, it was not possible to introduce usable instruments or deploy a silicone stent through the rigid bronchoscope. The decision was therefore made to deploy the smallest available silicone Y-stent (14 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 mm) through the tracheostomy stoma. The bronchial limbs were compressed with rigid forceps, and the stent was advanced toward the main carina under direct visualization using a flexible bronchoscope inserted through the left bronchial limb of the stent. After measurement, the tracheal limb was trimmed to 30 mm, the left bronchial limb to 20 mm, and the right bronchial limb to 10 mm. Advancement and seating of the stent were extremely challenging due to the patient\u2019s severely narrowed airways. Multiple techniques were employed, including manipulation with rigid optical forceps, advancement using Kelly clamps by otolaryngology under direct bronchoscopic visualization, gentle balloon dilation using a CRE balloon, and eventual insertion of a slightly larger 8-mm rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma and into the stent to help seat the bronchial limbs. During this maneuver, a small airway tear was visualized along the lateral aspect of the right mainstem bronchus, approximately 0.5 cm proximal to the right upper lobe orifice. This was felt to be caused by the distal edge of the right bronchial limb of the stent. Consideration was given to placement of a metallic stent to cover the defect; however, given concerns regarding metallic stents in benign airway disease, this was deferred. The patient received 1 gram of cefazolin intraoperatively. Thoracic surgery was consulted by phone, and based on their experience, recommended conservative management provided there was no evidence of pneumothorax. A portable chest radiograph demonstrated no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\n\nThe stent was slightly repositioned to optimize seating at the main carina. There was mild tenting of the distal right bronchial limb at the site of the airway tear that could not be corrected; otherwise, the stent was well seated, with resolution of distal tracheal and mainstem bronchial obstruction and patent distal airways. The patient\u2019s tracheostomy tube was reinserted under direct visualization through the stoma and positioned within the tracheal limb of the stent, where it was secured. The procedure was then concluded, and the patient was transferred to the ICU. Postoperative Course\n\nUpon arrival in the ICU, the patient was initially stable but subsequently developed an episode of acute hypoxia with transient PaO\u2082 <50%, associated with difficulty ventilating. This resolved rapidly with manual bag ventilation. Flexible bronchoscopy performed through the tracheostomy tube demonstrated no significant stent obstruction, though foamy, blood-tinged secretions were present, consistent with acute pulmonary edema. A chest radiograph obtained during this event showed no pneumothorax. The patient received 20 mg of furosemide intravenously, and the condom catheter was exchanged for a Foley catheter, resulting in brisk diuresis and significant improvement in tidal volumes. Persistently elevated ventilator pressures were felt to be related in part to the small tracheostomy tube. Under bronchoscopic visualization, the tracheostomy tube was exchanged for a 7.0 Bivona tracheostomy tube, which was positioned midway within the stent. This resulted in improved airway compliance and ventilation.\n\nThe patient was subsequently deemed stable. After discussion with the patient\u2019s parents, care was transitioned to the ICU team. Complications:\nSmall lateral right mainstem bronchial tear\n\nRecommendations\n\nContinue positive-pressure ventilation overnight\n\nEmpiric vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam for 7 days to prevent infection related to airway injury\n\nObtain noncontrast CT chest once the patient is stable enough for transport\n\nPlan for repeat bedside flexible bronchoscopy on or around 4/1/2019, or sooner if clinical concerns arise\n\nNotify the Interventional Pulmonology team immediately for any airway issues\n\nNote that the silicone stent is radiolucent and will not be visible on chest radiograph; CT or bronchoscopy should be used for evaluation of suspected stent-related complications\n\nAdminister 3% saline nebulizers three times daily starting tonight and continuing while the stent remains in place to reduce secretion burden and prevent stent obstruction\n\nIf tracheostomy tube removal or replacement is required, this must be performed under direct bronchoscopic visualization to ensure correct positioning within the stent and to avoid kinking or obstruction\n\nInterventional Pulmonology will continue to follow"}

On ultrasound, the mass appeared hypoechoic, heterogeneous, irregularly shaped, with sharp margins.\nMultiple surrounding vessels were noted, limiting safe needle trajectory. A small window for safe needle access was identified, and the mass was biopsied with a single pass using a 22-gauge needle.\nROSE preliminary analysis demonstrated atypical cells. However, brisk bleeding occurred following the first needle pass, and no additional ultrasound-guided passes were performed.\nAn esophageal approach was attempted but did not allow adequate visualization of the mass.\nThe EBUS bronchoscope was withdrawn, and a therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced.\nA conventional TBNA was attempted in the region of extrinsic compression in the left upper lobe posterior segment;\nhowever, the return was bloody, and no further passes were performed.\n\nAll samples were sent to cytopathology for review.\nComplications\n\nNo immediate complications.\n\nEstimated Blood Loss\n\nLess than 5 mL.\n\nImpression\n\nNormal bronchoscopic examination except for extrinsic compression of the left upper lobe posterior segment\n\nLymph node sizing and limited sampling performed via EBUS-TBNA\n\nPost-Procedure Diagnosis\n\nTechnically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy\n\nThe patient remained stable throughout the procedure and was transferred in good condition to the post-bronchoscopy recovery area for observation until discharge criteria were met.\nPreliminary findings were discussed with the patient.

The upper trachea was normal.\nThe mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the posterior wall causing about 30% airway obstruction.\nThe distal trachea had extensive tumor predominantly involving the right lateral and posterior wall and extending into the carina.\nThe very proximal left mainstem was partially obstructed from tumor infiltration of the main carina.\nBeyond this area the left mainstem, left upper and left lower lobe appeared normal without tumor involvement.\nAt the proximal aspect of the right mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing near complete obstruction (95%).\nTumor extraction was performed using APC and flexible forceps to \u201cburn and shave\u201d the tumor within the trachea and proximal right mainstem.\nOnce we were able to open the right mainstem up to the point that we could inspect the more distal airways we found extensive circumferential tumor infiltration extending to about 5mm distal to the right upper lobe.\nDistally from that point there was no evidence of tumor infiltration. There was extensive tumor within the right upper lobe.\nWe debulked the right mainstem and proximal BI area in a similar fashion.\nWe could not make out tissue plains as the tumor had completely infiltrated the airways.\nWe were able to achieve about 85% opening of the distal tracheal and 50% opening of the right mainstem.\nAt this point due to significant residual disease and fear that further debulking could result in airway perforation given that the airway tissue planes were completely lost from tumor infiltration the decision was made to place a silicone Y-stent for both improved patency and to prevent tumor ingrowth.\nWe also decided to extend stent beyond right upper lobe and \u201cjail\u201d the lobe due to tumor extension from within the right upper lobe which extended into the proximal bronchus intermedius.\nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 80mm in the tracheal limb, 30mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope (required for Y-stent insertion) was inserted through the cords and advanced into the proximal left mainstem and the stent was deployed.\nThrough the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we attempted to seed the stent in place however there was significant difficultly getting the right sided limb past the carinal infiltrative tumor and at one point the stent was noted to tear in the right sided limb.\nWe then removed the stent and inserted another stent of the same size using the same technique.\nAgain it was extremely difficult to get the stent to seed into proper position however after manipulating the stent with rigid forceps and by manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nDue to the prolonged nature of the procedure decision was made to intubate the patient prior to transfer back to the ICU.\nWe then removed the rigid bronchoscope and inserted a 7.0 ETT into the airway over a flexible bronchoscope to allow for visualization of the distal tip and directed the tip of the ETT into the proximal limb of the stent (about 2.5 cm into the stent) inflated the pilot balloon and secured the ETT in place.\nAt this point the procedure was completed and the case was turned over to anesthesia.\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-           Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured."}

The flexible bronchoscope and the tracheostomy tube were then removed and we attempted to insert a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope through the small tracheostomy stoma which was unsuccessful.\nWe then reinserted the tracheostomy tube and attempted to insert the rigid bronchoscope through the oral route however the patient had severely distorted upper airway anatomy and edema which made it impossible to visualize the posterior pharynx and vocal cords.\nWe then attempted insertion of progressively smaller rigid bronchoscope down to the smallest diameter of 6 mm without success due to a stricture is within the stoma tract.\nAt this point we called for otolaryngology\u2019s assistance in extending the stoma to allow insertion of the rigid bronchoscope.\nOnce they arrived, they attempted to visualize the vocal cords as well using suspension laryngoscopy but were unsuccessful.\nThey then surgically extended the tracheostomy stoma.  They were unable to extend the stoma to the point where the large rigid bronchoscope could be inserted due to significant scar tissue and concern for injury to the anterior trachea however they were able to extend it to the point we could insert the smaller rigid bronchoscopes.\nAt this point the 6 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma and advanced to the main carina.\nWe however unable to insert any usable instruments or have the ability to deploy the silicone stent through this rigid bronchoscope (due to size) and the decision was made to insert the smallest Y stent available (14 x 10 x 10) through the stoma with rigid forceps compressing the bronchial limbs and advance the stent to the main carina with visualization through a flexible bronchoscope inserted behind  through the left bronchial limb of the stent.\nAfter taking measurements the tracheal limb of the stent was cut to 30mm the left lime cut to 20mm and the right limb cut to 10mm.\nWe were eventually able to successfully advance the stent however the patient\u2019s airways were extremely narrowed and we had significant difficulty seating the bronchial limbs in place properly.\nWe used a variety of techniques including use of the rigid  optical forceps, advancement with Kelly clamps by ENT while we provided direct visualization with the flexible bronchoscope, insertion of CRE balloon to gently push the stent in the place and eventually insertion of the slightly larger  size 8 rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma, into the stent and manipulate the rigid scope to push the limbs into place.\nUnfortunately during this maneuver a small airway tear (likely caused by the distal edge of the stents right bronchial  limb) of the stoma was visualized at the lateral aspect of the right main stem approximately  half a centimeter above the right upper lobe.\nWe consider placing a metallic stent to cover this however were reluctant given the concerns of metallic stents and benign airway disease.\nThe patient was given 1 g of Ancef and we consulted thoracic surgery by phone to discuss options and based on their experience they felt that if there is no evidence of pneumothorax on chest x-ray this type of airway tears often resolves without intervention.\nA portable chest x-ray was then performed which showed no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\nWe are able to slightly advance the stent to see well at the main carina.\nThere was a slight tenting of the distal limb on the right at the distal margin of the airway tear which could not be corrected however otherwise the stent was well seated resulting in resolution of the distal tracheal and mainstem bronchi obstruction and the distal airways were patent.\nWe then reinserted the patient\u2019s tracheostomy tube through the stoma with direct visualization and into the tracheal limb of the stent where it was secured.\nAt this point the procedure was completed and the patient was transferred back to the ICU.\nOnce the patient arrived in the ICU at first he was doing relatively well however he had an episode of inability to ventilate and severe hypoxia with PO2 dropping below 50% transiently while we were still at the bedside.\nThis improved rapidly with manual bag ventilation. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy tube and there did not appear to be any significant obstruction of the stent however there was some foamy bloody airway secretions which were consistent with what would be seen in acute pulmonary edema.\nA chest x-ray was performed during this event (radiology technician was already at the bedside for preplanned chest x-ray) and no pneumothorax was seen.\n20 mg of Lasix were given and the patient\u2019s condom catheter was exchanged for a Foley catheter and there was a rapid diuresis after which his tidal volumes significantly improved.\nPressures required on the ventilator to maintain adequate tidal volumes were relatively high even after this maneuver and was felt  that the patient\u2019s extremely small tracheostomy tube might be contributing to high airway pressures.\nBecause of this we decided to remove the tracheostomy tube and over bronchoscopic visualization insert a 7.0 Boniva tracheostomy tube and secured this in place midway into the stent.\nThis seemed to improve his airway compliance and ventilation.  At this point the patient was deemed stable and after discussing case with parents care was turned over to the ICU team.\nComplications:  small lateral right mainstem airway tear\nRecommendations:\n-\tPatient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight\n-\tCombination vancomycin and Zosyn for 1 week to empirically prevent infection related to airway tear.\n-\tPlease obtain CT chest without contrast once patient has gained stable enough to transport.\n-\tPlan for repeat flexible bronchoscopy at bedside likely on 4/1/2019 or earlier if any concerns arise\n-\tPlease contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient.\n-\tThe patient\u2019s stent is radiolucent and will not be seen on chest x-ray, only CT.\nIf concern for stent related complication occurs flex bronchoscopy should be the first intervention followed by CT of the chest if clinically appropriate to evaluate for complications.\n-\tPatient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient\u2019s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.\n-\tIf tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.\n-\tWe will continue to follow."}

The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of stent obstruction.\nAt the distal edge of the stent there was some minor granulation tissue which was nonobstructive.\nDistal to the stent there was complete obstruction of the left lower lobe orifice secondary to granulation tissue.\nUsing the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract granulation tissue to visualize the segmental stenosis in the left lower lobe.\nAll of the segments were obstructed with granulation tissue as well which we also removed with cryotherapy as well as flexible forceps.\nAt this point we decided to remove the left mainstem stent for a few reasons.\nThe first is that pathology from previous bronchoscopy at time of stent placement did not show evidence of tumor and metallic stents are not advised for benign disease.\nThe second was that her new obstruction was secondary to distal granulation tissue and it was unclear whether the stent was providing any current benefit.\nFinally, our hope was that the short-term placement of the stent allowed some remodeling of the airway to relieve the previous obstruction.\nAt this point the LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway.\nUsing flexible forceps to grasp the proximal string on the stent we were able to gently retract the stent and remove it without difficulty.\nSubsequently they flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and as we had hoped the orifice had remodeled and essentially there is no obstruction at the level of the previous stent.\nAt the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.\nThen, using a 8\u20139\u201310 millimeter CRE balloon dilated each of the left lower lobe subsegments as well as the left lower lobe main bronchus which improved patency of the subsegments to approximately 50% of normal and left lower lobe bronchus to approximately 80%.\nCryotherapy was then performed with 30 second freeze/thaw cycles to induce tissue sloughing.\nFinally using the super dimension 21-gauge needle we injected a total of 5 mL of Kenalog 10 mg/milliliter solution into the submucosa have areas of significant granulation tissue in hopes of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect to prevent regrowth of granulation tissue.\nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.\nRecommendations:\n-\tTransfer patient back to the ICU\n-\tPost-procedure x-ray\n-\tPatient to follow-up with me for repeat bronchoscopy in about a week to remove debris post cryotherapy as well as to assess for evidence of restenosis."}

The upper trachea was normal.\nThe mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction.\nThe distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well.\nThe distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.\nIt appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression.\nTumor debulking  was performed using APC to  \u201cburn and shave\u201d the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent.\nThe right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina.\nThere was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.\nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position.\nPost-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent.\nWe then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured."}

The right upper lobe was eventually visualized.\nWe attempted to use APC to \"burn and shave\" residual airway tumor however patient would quickly desat with drops in FIO2 required to safely use thermal therapies.\nWe were able to debulk until what was likely the distal aspect of the BI but significant tumor still remained.\nPatient had extremely low reserve and since he continued to desaturate limiting our ability to continue debulk we decided to APC the base or the tumor as well as the residual tumor in the airway wall until we were confident that there was no active bleeding and abort attempts to further debulk for now and to consider returning to the OR at a later date.\nOnce this was accomplished the ETT position was confirmed to be 3cm above the carina.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and there procedure completed.

There were no complications.\nOf note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago.\nI suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\nRecommendations: \n\u2022\tTransfer patient back to ward room \n\u2022\tAwait final pathology results  \n\u2022\tWill need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy."}

The stent was well positioned and partially compressed externally.\nA 14/16.5/18 mm Elation dilatational balloon was used to dilate the stent after which the airway was approximately 90% of normal caliber.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nThe bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. \n\nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Discharge once criteria met.\n- Plan for repeat evaluation and possible stent replacement in approximately 2 weeks."}
