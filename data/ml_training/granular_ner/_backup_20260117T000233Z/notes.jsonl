No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.\nLeft Lung Proximal Airways: Large clot completely obstructing the LMSB - extending to the main carina.\nLUL and LLL also completely obstructed by clot.  After extraction of clot, the LMSB and LLL were otherwise normal in anatomy without endobronchial lesions.\nIncomplete assessment of LUL, as clot was not fully extracted from this area.\nMucosa: Mildly friable.\nSecretions: Thin, blood-tinged.\nAll secretions were suctioned to clear (therapeutic aspiration). \n \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, left lower lobe from blood clot and mucus.\nEndobronchial obstruction due to debris/clot was mechanically excised and removed using bland alligator forceps.\nForeign body removal of large endobronchial clot burden, which is not native to the airway, was performed.\nThe was performed using the below modalities:\n-Numerous cold saline flushing to dislodge clot and control any distal bleeding.\n-Therapeutic aspiration utilizing Neptune suction.\n-Bland alligator forceps\n \nAble to remove all clot from the LMSB and majority of LLL and LB7/8-10.\nThis included a large cast of clot that was dislodged and removed from LLL truncus basalis and basilar segments.\nSome partially obstructing clot remained in the LLL superior segment (LB6), which could not be extracted despite extensive time.\nView from mid LMSB with patent LLL bronchus and partially patent LUL bronchus.\nLLL superior segment with residual partially obstructing clot:\n \nThe LUL remained largely filled with clot, although there may be some partial ventilation occurring here based on bubbling/tidaling of clot seen.\nThe  LUL Aspergilloma is the suspsected source of bleed.\nTherefore, LUL clot was intentionally left in place to allow to organize and prevent further bleeding from the LUL.\nClot remaining in LUL. \n \n \nThere was no active bleeding or pooling blood seen.\nIn hopes of preventing recurrence of active bleeding, the following endobronchial medications were instilled:\nEndobronchial epinephrine 0.4mg was instilled into the LUL - targeting LB1/2 and LB3.\nEndobronchial tranexamic acid 1000mg was instilled into the LUL - targeting LB1/2 and LB3.\nA Uniblocker 9Fr was the only bronchial blocker available.  The Uniblocker ventilator adaptor was attached to the tracheostomy tube and the the 9Fr bronchial balloon blocker balloon was guided into the distal LMSB under direct visualization (using parallel Slim disposable scope via the tracheostomy tube).\n-The bronchial blocker balloon was inflated to fully occlude the left mainstem bronchus.\n-Placed at 25-26cm at the dark blue securement device.  Bronchial blocker secured tightly in position using this securement device.\n-Confirmed that 8cc of air was needed to adequately inflate the balloon to fully occlude the LMSB.\nThe endobronchial blocker balloon was then deflated and left in the distal LMSB in case emergently needed for recurrent massive hemoptysis.\nResidual secretions, saline, and minimal blood suctioned to clear.

\nNeck Ultrasound was performed to evaluate for any abnormal vessel, mass, structures at the site of percutaneous tracheostomy.\nThere were no significant vessels/mass were noted overlying the tracheostomy site on examination from the laryngeal prominence to the sternal notch.\nThe bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization.\nThe inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized.\nNext, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\nLidocaine 1% 3ml ml was injected into the anterior neck.\nA 1 cm incision was made horizontally with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.\nSuture (3-0 prolene) was placed around the incision site to create a Rummel tourniquet.\nThe introducer needle was then passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization.\nNext, a J-wire was passed through the catheter, also visualized with the bronchoscope.\nThe site was then dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.\nThe 14 Fr dilator was then removed from the guide wire and an 8 Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level.\nThe tissue dilator was placed over the guiding catheter

Ventilator settings, labs, and body habitus adequate for bedside procedure.\nHas slightly high riding innominate artery (though not classic) as well as a large bridging neck vein.\nVV ECMO/DVT/PE anticoagulation held and will restart shortly thereafter. Consent signed.\nDetails of Procedure Performed:  \n \nThe patient remained in the ICU with a previously placed single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nThe patient was positioned supine with a padded shoulder roll in place, the head of bed elevated, and the neck moderately extended.\nA surgical brief was performed and the level of inspired fraction of oxygen was reduced to 40%.\nPatient remained on VV ECMO support. After adequate anesthesia, landmarks were palpated including the thyroid notch, cricoid, and suprasternal notch.\nNeck ultrasound was performed to confirm vascular anatomy. Exposure was excellent.\nThe anterior neck was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. \n \nA surgical time out was performed.\n5mL of 1% lidocaine was injected 2-3 cm above the sternal notch.\nIt was made higher due to the known partially high-riding innominate.\nA 3cm horizontal skin incision was made with a #15 blade knife in a natural, relaxed skin tension line midway between the cricoid cartilage and the sternal notch.\nBovie cautery was used to dissect through the platysma and down to the strap muscles, with effort made to avoid the anterior jugular veins.\nThere were two vertical engorged veins along the midline raphe with a bridging vein between then.\nThe bridging vein was dissected, suture ligated, and divided. This allowed visualization of the midline raphe.\nThe strap muscles were separated vertically at the midline with Bovie cautery. The strap muscles are retracted laterally.\nUsing a combination of blunt and careful cautery midline dissection, the anterior tracheal wall was freed of soft tissue.\nThe innominate artery was identified and protected. There was good soft tissue between the innominate and the trachea which was not disturbed.\nThe trachea was palpated to find the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings.\nThere was adequate distance between the innominate artery and the planned insertion site.\nUnder bronchoscopic guidance, the endotracheal tube cuff was deflated and was pulled back below the level of the vocal cords.\nA finder needle was placed through the anterior trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilaginous rings.\nOnce confirmed by bronchoscopy, a seldinger technique was used to serially dilate the tracheotomy over a wire and to place a # 7 cuffed shiley tracheostomy.\nThe tracheostomy cuff was inflated. Cross table ventilation was performed and the tracheostomy placement was confirmed by bronchoscopy through the tracheostomy as well as CO2 return on the anesthesia monitor.\nThe tracheostomy inner cannula was then placed. Surgicel was placed in the wound bed though hemostasis was great but plan to resume anticoagulation very shortly.\nThe tracheostomy was secured with loose 2-0 prolene sutures to the skin and tracheostomy straps to maintain airway but prevent skin pressure injuries.\nThe endotracheal tube was then withdrawn completely. The tracheostomy obturator was provided to the bedside care team.\nThe patient remained in the ICU in critical condition. There were no complications.\nAt the end of the procedure, I contacted her husband Carl Pinell at 626-991-6311 \n \nEBL: 1ml\n \nFluids: per anesthesia record\n \nSpecimens: none\n \nImplants: none\n \nDrains: none\n \nComplications: none immediately apparent\n \nDisposition: stable, ventilated, remained in ICU, on VV ECMO\n \nPlan: \nOkay to resume bival in 1 hour\nTrach ties to stay for 7-10 days\nNo need for routine trach exchange within first 14 day if not having issues\nDo not over inflate the cuff"}

Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.\nBronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).\nInstilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.\nSamples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n \nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA.\nThe patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the subglottic posterior trachea where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging.\nNo suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspeciton with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope.\nPOSTERIOR MEMBRANE DEFECT\nAdvanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation.\nThe defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum.\nThe scope was subsequently introduced into the esophagus to evaluate for esophageal injury.\nWith Gastroenterology present, the length of the esophagus was examined and no esophageal defect/injury was identified.\nDecision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed.\nThe black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth.\nThe vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them.\nOnce the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed.\nIntubation was easy. \n \n \nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\n \n \t \nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect\t 8 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom \t2.5 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina\t3 cm\n \nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion as described above.\nIntubation was easy. \n \nA silicone Y-stent (16mm x 13mm x 13mm) was initially modified to have tracheal portion cover the defect with short bronchial limbs for migration prevention.\nHowever, significant difficulty was encountered advancing the stent into the deployer, eventually causing a mild tear of a bronchial limb.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular tracheal stent measuring 16mmx 45mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea.\nThe rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place.\n12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 15 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).\nTotal 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.\nSILICONE

Purulent secretions were seen throughout the airways.\nOnce secretions were suctioned inspection of the right sided airways should multiple small endobronchial nodular lesions concerning for airway metastasis.\nOn the left in the mid left mainstem a 1.5cm fistula was seen at the medial aspect of the posterior wall.\nDistally (similar to what was seen on the right) were multiple small endobronchial lesions with an appearance suggestive of malignancy.\nMultiple nodules from the left and right side were biopsied with flexible forceps and placed in formalin.\nAt this point we measured the length of the fistula and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the fistula within the left mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the selected area required to cover the fistula with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 14x30 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed slightly too proximally with the distal edge just covering the fistula.\nWe then decided to place a second 14x40 Aero stent into the previously place stent to better cover the obstruction.\nThis was done in a similar fashion. On inspection after placement the originally placed stent was noted to have been pushed distally by the second stent (more distal than desired and obstructing the orifice of the left upper and lower lobe. We then removed the 14x40 stent by grasping the proximal edge with forceps. The stent could not be retracted through the tracheostomy so the trach tube was removed and then the stent was pulled through the stoma, after which re re-inserted the trach over a bronchoscope and re-attached it to the ventilator. We then retraced the remaining 14x30 mm \nAero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent into proper position (within the left mainstem covering the fistula) with forceps. Once this was done and we were satisfied with the final result the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

{"id": "note_141", "text": "Preoperative Diagnosis:\nNear-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia\n\nPostoperative Diagnosis:\nNear-complete tracheal occlusion secondary to granulation tissue and severe tracheomalacia\n\nProcedure Performed:\nRigid bronchoscopy with silicone Y-stent placement\n\nIndication:\nNear-complete tracheal obstruction requiring urgent intervention\n\nAnesthesia:\nGeneral anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure\n\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure after discussion, in lay terms, of the indications, procedural details, risks, benefits, and alternatives. The patient acknowledged understanding and agreed to proceed.\n\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. Initial airway inspection was performed using an ultra-slim Olympus P190 flexible bronchoscope inserted through the patient’s customized 5.5-mm tracheostomy tube. At the distal margin of the tracheostomy tube, approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina, there was a ridge of granulation tissue occluding approximately 80% of the tracheostomy tube lumen. Distal to this obstruction, there was severe tracheobronchial malacia with near-complete collapse of the distal trachea and right mainstem bronchus, and approximately 75% obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus. The airway mucosa was diffusely erythematous and inflamed.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope and tracheostomy tube were removed, and an attempt was made to insert a 14-mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma; this was unsuccessful due to the small size of the stoma. The tracheostomy tube was reinserted, and rigid bronchoscopy was then attempted via the oral route. However, the patient had severely distorted upper airway anatomy and significant edema, making visualization of the posterior pharynx and vocal cords impossible. Attempts were made to insert progressively smaller rigid bronchoscopes, down to a 6-mm scope, but these were unsuccessful due to a fixed stricture within the tracheostomy tract. At this point, otolaryngology was consulted intraoperatively for assistance with surgical extension of the tracheostomy stoma. Otolaryngology also attempted visualization of the vocal cords using suspension laryngoscopy but was unsuccessful. The tracheostomy stoma was surgically extended; however, due to extensive scar tissue and concern for injury to the anterior trachea, the stoma could not be enlarged sufficiently to accommodate a large rigid bronchoscope. It was, however, extended enough to allow insertion of smaller rigid bronchoscopes. A 6-mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma and advanced to the main carina. Due to the small diameter of the scope, it was not possible to introduce usable instruments or deploy a silicone stent through the rigid bronchoscope. The decision was therefore made to deploy the smallest available silicone Y-stent (14 × 10 × 10 mm) through the tracheostomy stoma. The bronchial limbs were compressed with rigid forceps, and the stent was advanced toward the main carina under direct visualization using a flexible bronchoscope inserted through the left bronchial limb of the stent. After measurement, the tracheal limb was trimmed to 30 mm, the left bronchial limb to 20 mm, and the right bronchial limb to 10 mm. Advancement and seating of the stent were extremely challenging due to the patient’s severely narrowed airways. Multiple techniques were employed, including manipulation with rigid optical forceps, advancement using Kelly clamps by otolaryngology under direct bronchoscopic visualization, gentle balloon dilation using a CRE balloon, and eventual insertion of a slightly larger 8-mm rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma and into the stent to help seat the bronchial limbs. During this maneuver, a small airway tear was visualized along the lateral aspect of the right mainstem bronchus, approximately 0.5 cm proximal to the right upper lobe orifice. This was felt to be caused by the distal edge of the right bronchial limb of the stent. Consideration was given to placement of a metallic stent to cover the defect; however, given concerns regarding metallic stents in benign airway disease, this was deferred. The patient received 1 gram of cefazolin intraoperatively. Thoracic surgery was consulted by phone, and based on their experience, recommended conservative management provided there was no evidence of pneumothorax. A portable chest radiograph demonstrated no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\n\nThe stent was slightly repositioned to optimize seating at the main carina. There was mild tenting of the distal right bronchial limb at the site of the airway tear that could not be corrected; otherwise, the stent was well seated, with resolution of distal tracheal and mainstem bronchial obstruction and patent distal airways. The patient’s tracheostomy tube was reinserted under direct visualization through the stoma and positioned within the tracheal limb of the stent, where it was secured. The procedure was then concluded, and the patient was transferred to the ICU. Postoperative Course\n\nUpon arrival in the ICU, the patient was initially stable but subsequently developed an episode of acute hypoxia with transient PaO₂ <50%, associated with difficulty ventilating. This resolved rapidly with manual bag ventilation. Flexible bronchoscopy performed through the tracheostomy tube demonstrated no significant stent obstruction, though foamy, blood-tinged secretions were present, consistent with acute pulmonary edema. A chest radiograph obtained during this event showed no pneumothorax. The patient received 20 mg of furosemide intravenously, and the condom catheter was exchanged for a Foley catheter, resulting in brisk diuresis and significant improvement in tidal volumes. Persistently elevated ventilator pressures were felt to be related in part to the small tracheostomy tube. Under bronchoscopic visualization, the tracheostomy tube was exchanged for a 7.0 Bivona tracheostomy tube, which was positioned midway within the stent. This resulted in improved airway compliance and ventilation.\n\nThe patient was subsequently deemed stable. After discussion with the patient’s parents, care was transitioned to the ICU team. Complications:\nSmall lateral right mainstem bronchial tear\n\nRecommendations\n\nContinue positive-pressure ventilation overnight\n\nEmpiric vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam for 7 days to prevent infection related to airway injury\n\nObtain noncontrast CT chest once the patient is stable enough for transport\n\nPlan for repeat bedside flexible bronchoscopy on or around 4/1/2019, or sooner if clinical concerns arise\n\nNotify the Interventional Pulmonology team immediately for any airway issues\n\nNote that the silicone stent is radiolucent and will not be visible on chest radiograph; CT or bronchoscopy should be used for evaluation of suspected stent-related complications\n\nAdminister 3% saline nebulizers three times daily starting tonight and continuing while the stent remains in place to reduce secretion burden and prevent stent obstruction\n\nIf tracheostomy tube removal or replacement is required, this must be performed under direct bronchoscopic visualization to ensure correct positioning within the stent and to avoid kinking or obstruction\n\nInterventional Pulmonology will continue to follow"}

The upper trachea was normal.\nThe mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the posterior wall causing about 30% airway obstruction.\nThe distal trachea had extensive tumor predominantly involving the right lateral and posterior wall and extending into the carina.\nThe very proximal left mainstem was partially obstructed from tumor infiltration of the main carina.\nBeyond this area the left mainstem, left upper and left lower lobe appeared normal without tumor involvement.\nAt the proximal aspect of the right mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing near complete obstruction (95%).\nTumor extraction was performed using APC and flexible forceps to “burn and shave” the tumor within the trachea and proximal right mainstem.\nOnce we were able to open the right mainstem up to the point that we could inspect the more distal airways we found extensive circumferential tumor infiltration extending to about 5mm distal to the right upper lobe.\nDistally from that point there was no evidence of tumor infiltration. There was extensive tumor within the right upper lobe.\nWe debulked the right mainstem and proximal BI area in a similar fashion.\nWe could not make out tissue plains as the tumor had completely infiltrated the airways.\nWe were able to achieve about 85% opening of the distal tracheal and 50% opening of the right mainstem.\nAt this point due to significant residual disease and fear that further debulking could result in airway perforation given that the airway tissue planes were completely lost from tumor infiltration the decision was made to place a silicone Y-stent for both improved patency and to prevent tumor ingrowth.\nWe also decided to extend stent beyond right upper lobe and “jail” the lobe due to tumor extension from within the right upper lobe which extended into the proximal bronchus intermedius.\nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 80mm in the tracheal limb, 30mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope (required for Y-stent insertion) was inserted through the cords and advanced into the proximal left mainstem and the stent was deployed.\nThrough the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we attempted to seed the stent in place however there was significant difficultly getting the right sided limb past the carinal infiltrative tumor and at one point the stent was noted to tear in the right sided limb.\nWe then removed the stent and inserted another stent of the same size using the same technique.\nAgain it was extremely difficult to get the stent to seed into proper position however after manipulating the stent with rigid forceps and by manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nDue to the prolonged nature of the procedure decision was made to intubate the patient prior to transfer back to the ICU.\nWe then removed the rigid bronchoscope and inserted a 7.0 ETT into the airway over a flexible bronchoscope to allow for visualization of the distal tip and directed the tip of the ETT into the proximal limb of the stent (about 2.5 cm into the stent) inflated the pilot balloon and secured the ETT in place.\nAt this point the procedure was completed and the case was turned over to anesthesia.\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-           Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.\nIntubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.\nThe endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured."}

The flexible bronchoscope and the tracheostomy tube were then removed and we attempted to insert a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope through the small tracheostomy stoma which was unsuccessful.\nWe then reinserted the tracheostomy tube and attempted to insert the rigid bronchoscope through the oral route however the patient had severely distorted upper airway anatomy and edema which made it impossible to visualize the posterior pharynx and vocal cords.\nWe then attempted insertion of progressively smaller rigid bronchoscope down to the smallest diameter of 6 mm without success due to a stricture is within the stoma tract.\nAt this point we called for otolaryngology’s assistance in extending the stoma to allow insertion of the rigid bronchoscope.\nOnce they arrived, they attempted to visualize the vocal cords as well using suspension laryngoscopy but were unsuccessful.\nThey then surgically extended the tracheostomy stoma.  They were unable to extend the stoma to the point where the large rigid bronchoscope could be inserted due to significant scar tissue and concern for injury to the anterior trachea however they were able to extend it to the point we could insert the smaller rigid bronchoscopes.\nAt this point the 6 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy stoma and advanced to the main carina.\nWe however unable to insert any usable instruments or have the ability to deploy the silicone stent through this rigid bronchoscope (due to size) and the decision was made to insert the smallest Y stent available (14 x 10 x 10) through the stoma with rigid forceps compressing the bronchial limbs and advance the stent to the main carina with visualization through a flexible bronchoscope inserted behind  through the left bronchial limb of the stent.\nAfter taking measurements the tracheal limb of the stent was cut to 30mm the left lime cut to 20mm and the right limb cut to 10mm.\nWe were eventually able to successfully advance the stent however the patient’s airways were extremely narrowed and we had significant difficulty seating the bronchial limbs in place properly.\nWe used a variety of techniques including use of the rigid  optical forceps, advancement with Kelly clamps by ENT while we provided direct visualization with the flexible bronchoscope, insertion of CRE balloon to gently push the stent in the place and eventually insertion of the slightly larger  size 8 rigid bronchoscope through the tracheostomy stoma, into the stent and manipulate the rigid scope to push the limbs into place.\nUnfortunately during this maneuver a small airway tear (likely caused by the distal edge of the stents right bronchial  limb) of the stoma was visualized at the lateral aspect of the right main stem approximately  half a centimeter above the right upper lobe.\nWe consider placing a metallic stent to cover this however were reluctant given the concerns of metallic stents and benign airway disease.\nThe patient was given 1 g of Ancef and we consulted thoracic surgery by phone to discuss options and based on their experience they felt that if there is no evidence of pneumothorax on chest x-ray this type of airway tears often resolves without intervention.\nA portable chest x-ray was then performed which showed no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\nWe are able to slightly advance the stent to see well at the main carina.\nThere was a slight tenting of the distal limb on the right at the distal margin of the airway tear which could not be corrected however otherwise the stent was well seated resulting in resolution of the distal tracheal and mainstem bronchi obstruction and the distal airways were patent.\nWe then reinserted the patient’s tracheostomy tube through the stoma with direct visualization and into the tracheal limb of the stent where it was secured.\nAt this point the procedure was completed and the patient was transferred back to the ICU.\nOnce the patient arrived in the ICU at first he was doing relatively well however he had an episode of inability to ventilate and severe hypoxia with PO2 dropping below 50% transiently while we were still at the bedside.\nThis improved rapidly with manual bag ventilation. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy tube and there did not appear to be any significant obstruction of the stent however there was some foamy bloody airway secretions which were consistent with what would be seen in acute pulmonary edema.\nA chest x-ray was performed during this event (radiology technician was already at the bedside for preplanned chest x-ray) and no pneumothorax was seen.\n20 mg of Lasix were given and the patient’s condom catheter was exchanged for a Foley catheter and there was a rapid diuresis after which his tidal volumes significantly improved.\nPressures required on the ventilator to maintain adequate tidal volumes were relatively high even after this maneuver and was felt  that the patient’s extremely small tracheostomy tube might be contributing to high airway pressures.\nBecause of this we decided to remove the tracheostomy tube and over bronchoscopic visualization insert a 7.0 Boniva tracheostomy tube and secured this in place midway into the stent.\nThis seemed to improve his airway compliance and ventilation.  At this point the patient was deemed stable and after discussing case with parents care was turned over to the ICU team.\nComplications:  small lateral right mainstem airway tear\nRecommendations:\n-\tPatient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight\n-\tCombination vancomycin and Zosyn for 1 week to empirically prevent infection related to airway tear.\n-\tPlease obtain CT chest without contrast once patient has gained stable enough to transport.\n-\tPlan for repeat flexible bronchoscopy at bedside likely on 4/1/2019 or earlier if any concerns arise\n-\tPlease contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient.\n-\tThe patient’s stent is radiolucent and will not be seen on chest x-ray, only CT.\nIf concern for stent related complication occurs flex bronchoscopy should be the first intervention followed by CT of the chest if clinically appropriate to evaluate for complications.\n-\tPatient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.\n-\tIf tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.\n-\tWe will continue to follow."}

The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM).\nThe right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction.\nA few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane.\nThe proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall.\nIn the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent.\nAfter gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout.\n10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared.\nSignificant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture.\nAfter suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall.\nThe left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease.\n\nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator.\nThe rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent.\nAPC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue.\nWe then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa.\nAfter this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall.\nWe repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway.\nWe then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent.\nAPC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris.\nSignificant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present.\nAt this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success;\nhowever, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius.\nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement.\nWe customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb.\nWe also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed.\nAfter deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.\nPersistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was removed, and an LMA was inserted, and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care.\nRecommendations:\n\n•\tTransfer to PACU\n•\tObtain post-procedure chest x-ray.\n•\tPatient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation, given residual disease.\n•\tPatient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucus impaction and obstruction of stent.\n•\tManagement of stent-related complications was discussed with the in-patient team, and a notice for airway management precautions was placed above the patient's bed.\n•\tPlan to schedule the procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after the effects of radiation should be seen)."}

Mild tumor infiltration was present in the airway wall until just proximal to the takeoff of the anterior-medial segment of the left lower lobe and distal to that the airways were un-effected.\nGiven that the patient has had tumor progression despite chemotherapy we felt that airway stent placement was warranted to preserve the lower lobe and prevent regrowth of tumor (barrier effect) with the understanding that this would “jail” the superior segment of the lower lobe and we would essentially sacrifice one segment to preserve the rest of the lobe.\nAt this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed bronchus intermedius with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.\nThe flexible bronchoscope was removed and a Ultraflex 30mm x 10mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed however slightly too proximal and subsequently was removed using forceps.\nThe jagwire was re-inserted and using a similar technique an Aero 30mm x 12mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.\nThe stent was deployed without difficulty and the flexible bronchoscope was then re-inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the stent was observed to be well-seated in the left lower lobe and distal mainstem with the distal tip just proximal to the basilar segments of the lower lobe.\nOnce we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.\nA few minutes later while anesthesia was bagging the patient as she emerged she became difficult to ventilate and hypoxic.\nAn LMA was inserted but she could still not ventilate and anesthesia then inserted an endotracheal tube after which ventilation was restored and hypoxia resolved.\nIt was felt this episode was caused by acute laryngospasm.\nWe then inserted a flexible bronchoscope through the ETT to inspect the airways and reposition the tube proximal to the carina (was right mainstem intubated.

The tumor was mostly confined to the posterior and left lateral wall. At the distal aspect of the tumor (3cm proximal to the main carina there was an obvious fistulous communication with the esophagus in the left recess between the posterior and lateral tracheal wall.  The distal 3 cm of the trachea appeared normal. There was purulent material in the left mainstem which was suctioned and all airways beyond the trachea appeared normal without evidence of mucosal irregularities of endobronchial disease. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were \nremoved and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea and with bronchoscopic observation placed a 16x60 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent. The stent deployed more distally than expected with the distal edge within the right mainstem and the proximal edge not fully covering the obstruction.\nWe were able to pull the stent proximally but slightly more proximal than expected to cover the upper tracheal obstruction but the distal margin and TE fistula remained exposed.\nAt this point our thought was that the obstruction was covered and that GI would place a stent to cover the fistula.\nThe rigid bronchoscope was removed and GI then attempted through EGD to place the stent but were unable to bypass the esophageal obstruction.\nWe then re-intubated with the tracheoscope and using a similar technique to before and using forceps biopsied the exposed tumor.\nWe then placed a second 16X60 aero SEM into the distal trachea telescoping into the more proximal stent.\nThis resulted in complete occlusion of the fistula and complete opening of the trachea to a normal diameter.\nAt this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen.\nOnce the patient was felt to be able to adequately protect airway the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.\nPost procedure diagnosis:\nMixed infiltrative tumor of the trachea and TE fistula s/p tracheal stenting with complete recanalization and obstruction of fistula \nRecommendations:\n- Transfer to PACU\n- Await tissue diagnosis\n- Obtain post procedure CXR- TID saline nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent"}

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions, there was extrinsic compression noted in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which precluded deeper visual inspection of suspected endobronchial disease within the segment. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11L lymph node. Further details regarding nodal size are in the table below. The EBUS scope was positioned in the origin of the left lower lobe and turned posteriorly to visualize the lung mass abutting the airway which measured 31.5mm in short axis diameter. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. We then reintroduced the EBUS scope into the left lower lobe and visualized the mass abutting the airway and EBUS guided sampling was performed of the mass with the EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation yielded tissue concerning for malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology and additional needle passes were performed for molecular studies. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. There were no complications.

Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038\" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.\nTwo 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.\nThe tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.\nSerial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).\nThe introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).\nThe catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site.

General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE\n\nCOMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION\n\nThe convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC180F) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.\n\nStation 10R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 21.2 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma. Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 8.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 13.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nCOMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.5 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).\n\nRadial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.\n\nRAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\nOn-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed granuloma.\n\nPROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS\n\nThe procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RUL pulmonary lesion\n3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - adenocarcinoma\n4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed\n\nTotal Procedure Duration: 131 minutes\n\nElectronically Signed,\nEric Johnson, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center"}

Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.\nWe discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.\nProcedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement\nHow it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.\nThrough the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.\nMultiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.\nAfter biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.\nPathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry\nPatient [REDACTED] throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.\nFollow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung.

{"id": "1350268", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], Jonathan Wood, a 54-year-old female patient, presented to Memorial Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Michael Rodriguez, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 28.6 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 8.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 36 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 17.1 millimeters in short axis and 25.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 8.4 millimeters in short axis and 34.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 22.2 millimeters in short axis and 34.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.9 millimeters in short axis and 28.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 18.5 millimeters in short axis and 22.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 11:02, for a total procedure time of 92 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nMichael Rodriguez, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"}

{"id": "1377952", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], [REDACTED], a 41-year-old male patient, presented to Memorial Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Robert Patel, MD, with Priya Sharma assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 24.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the superior lingula (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 49 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.5 millimeters in short axis and 32.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.1 millimeters in short axis and 12.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 8.8 millimeters in short axis and 15.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL superior lingula (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:18, for a total procedure time of 108 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nRobert Patel, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"}

Medical thoracoscopy planned for definitive diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube (left-sided)\n\nPROCEDURE NARRATIVE:\n\nMEDICAL THORACOSCOPY ATTEMPT (Dr. Anderson):\nPatient [REDACTED] left lateral decubitus. After induction of general anesthesia and lung isolation, the right chest was prepped and draped. Ultrasound examination revealed a small pocket of fluid in the mid-axillary line but significant lung adherence to chest wall throughout.\n\nA 2cm incision was made in the 6th intercostal space. Upon blunt dissection into the pleural space, immediate dense adhesions were encountered. The 7mm trocar could not be safely advanced due to extensive lung-to-chest-wall adhesions. A small pocket of loculated fluid (~200mL) was drained but no window could be created for safe pleuroscopy. Multiple attempts at different intercostal spaces (5th, 7th) encountered similar dense adhesions.\n\nDECISION TO CONVERT: After thorough discussion with thoracic surgery colleagues and the patient's family (who had been counseled preoperatively about this possibility), the decision was made to convert to VATS for safe completion of the procedure.\n\nVATS PROCEDURE (Dr. Kim):\nThe incision was extended and a 10mm port placed under direct vision where a small pleural space was id[REDACTED]. Two additional 5mm ports were placed. Dense adhesions were found throughout the hemithorax. Using a combination of blunt dissection, electrocautery, and harmonic scalpel, extensive adhesiolysis was performed over approximately 90 minutes.\n\nFindings:\n- Dense fibrinous adhesions throughout\n- Thickened visceral pleura with trapped lung\n- Nodular thickening of parietal pleura (multiple biopsies taken)\n- Approximately 500mL of loculated, amber-colored fluid drained\n\nMultiple parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from chest wall and diaphragmatic pleura. Partial decortication of the visceral pleura was performed to allow lung expansion, though complete expansion could not be achieved due to chronic entrapment.\n\nA 28Fr chest tube was placed. Negative-pressure water seal established. Lung expansion approximately 70% at end of case.\n\nSPECIMENS:\n- Pleural fluid: Cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures, adenosine deaminase\n- Pleural biopsies (multiple): Surgical pathology\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150mL\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively.

{"id": "1528559", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], Dorothy Price, a 53-year-old female patient, presented to Community Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Andrew Nakamura, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.3 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the superior (B6) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 23 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 14.4 millimeters in short axis and 23.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.7 millimeters in short axis and 20.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 19.2 millimeters in short axis and 34.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.4 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL superior (B6). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 09:49, for a total procedure time of 94 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nAndrew Nakamura, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"}

Transferred to PACU in stable condition.\nSPECIMENS\nNone (non-excisional therapy)\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\nThis 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven [REDACTED]) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.\nTimeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:\n\nScheduled debridement bronchoscopy: [REDACTED] (48 hours post-light)\nAnticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal\nWill assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed\n\nOngoing Management:\n\nContinue light precautions (patient education reinforced)\nMonitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions\nDexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)\nPPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)\nDebridement session in 2 days\n\nLong-term surveillance:\nBronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.\nProcedure Note - EBV Removal\nPatient [REDACTED] 59M MRN [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Dr. Amanda Foster attending\nIndication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.\nPatient [REDACTED] OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.\nValve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.\nValve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.\nValve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.\nAfter valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.\nLeft lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.\nSpecimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.\nFollow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve. Will see in clinic 2 weeks."}

She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.\nBrought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).\nSo here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.\nAfter cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.\nThe distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.\nDid a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.\nRecommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.\nOverall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks."}

The indication was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a 14.5mm ground-glass lesion in the RUL anterior (B3), bronchus sign positive. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 50 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope with 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 11L (13.3mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 7 (10.0mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 2L (24.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system (Auris Health (J&J)) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 3.2mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RUL anterior (B3) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed concentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by radial ebus. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed atypical cells.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 136 minutes. Attending physician: Brian O'Connor, MD."}

Recent CT showed stent fracture with proximal wire protruding into the trachea. Patient symptomatic with worsening cough and hemoptysis.\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was intubated with a 12mm Bryan-Dumon ventilating rigid bronchoscope. Examination of the trachea revealed the fractured proximal portion of the right mainstem SEMS protruding approximately 1.5cm into the distal trachea. The fractured wire ends were sharp and had caused mucosal injury with surrounding granulation tissue formation.\n\nA flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid scope to examine beyond the stent. The stent lumen was narrowed by approximately 40% due to granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal end. The distal right bronchus intermedius appeared patent.\n\nThe granulation tissue was treated with APC (ERBE VIO, 30W, Effect 2) at the proximal stent margin, achieving adequate hemostasis and improving visualization.\n\nUsing a combination of rigid optical forceps and alligator forceps, the proximal edge of the stent was grasped. The stent was collapsed using the forceps in a rolling fashion and withdrawn en bloc through the rigid bronchoscope.\n\nInspection of the airway post-removal revealed:\n- Mild residual granulation tissue at the former stent site (treated with APC)\n- No perforation or significant bleeding\n- Bronchus intermedius patent\n- Right upper, middle, and lower lobe orifices patent\n\nFinal inspection showed no debris, no significant bleeding, patent airways bilaterally.

Using anatomic landmarks only (no EBUS or ultrasound), multiple passes were made through the bronchial wall just proximal to the main carina targeting the subcarinal (station 7) lymph node seen on imaging (short-axis 15 mm). Four needle passes were performed with suction applied on each pass, yielding blood-tinged material with visible tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: An on-site cytotechnologist was present. Rapid on-site evaluation showed abundant lymphocytes with clusters of malignant epithelial cells, consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Adequacy was confirmed after the third pass; a fourth pass was performed for cell block and ancillary studies.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 7 conventional TBNA x4 passes, submitted for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry with reflex molecular studies if malignant.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Minimal oozing at the puncture site resolved with suction and cold saline. No significant bleeding, hypoxia, or hemodynamic instability. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigational bronchoscopy was used at any point; this was a purely conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was monitored in the bronchoscopy recovery area and discharged home in stable condition. Final cytology, cell block, and molecular profiling from station 7 will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board. Further management (surgical resection versus chemoradiation or systemic therapy) will be based on complete staging results."}

{"id": "1970412", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], Susan Rodriguez, a 46-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Jason Park assisting.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 30.4 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 13.0. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 46 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 15.3 millimeters in short axis and 24.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 23.0 millimeters in short axis and 31.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 15.0 millimeters in short axis and 25.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:49, for a total procedure time of 79 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nLisa Thompson, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"}

{"id": "2025-IP-9847", "text": "PATIENT NAME: [REDACTED]\nMEDICAL RECORD [REDACTED]: 2025-IP-9847\nDATE OF BIRTH: [REDACTED] (Age 70 years)\nPROCEDURE DATE: [REDACTED]\nINSTITUTION: [REDACTED]\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Kevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nFELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)\nANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nLeft lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on [REDACTED] yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative\n\nOPERATION PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule\n\nCLINICAL SCENARIO:\nPatient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nAfter obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. \n\nGeneral anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. \n\nOlympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:\n- Normal supraglottic structures\n- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia\n- Carina: sharp, mobile\n- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy\n- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from [REDACTED] with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment id[REDACTED] at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.\n\nRegistration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). \n\nSteerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.\n\nRadial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.\n\nFluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).\n\nCryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:\n\nCycle 1: \n- Freeze time: 6 minutes\n- Temperature at probe tip: -165°C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20°C)\n\nCycle 2:\n- Freeze time: 6 minutes  \n- Temperature: -167°C\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes\n\nCycle 3:\n- Freeze time: 5 minutes\n- Temperature: -163°C\n- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)\n\nThroughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.\n\nPost-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.\n\nCryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:\n- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)\n- No hemorrhage\n- No airway perforation\n- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)\n\nComplete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. \n\nBronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target\n2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)\n3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS\n4. No procedural complications\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\n\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nDRAINS/TUBES: None placed\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring\n2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry\n3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications\n4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging\n5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain\n6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)\n7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen\n8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake\n9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated\n10. Diet as tolerated\n11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)\n\nFOLLOW-UP PLAN:\n- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course\n- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray\n- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)\n- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation\n- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually\n\nDISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:\nExtensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.\n\nTotal procedure time: 94 minutes\nFluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes  \nRadiation dose: 287 mGy-cm²\n\nATTESTATION: I was present for and personally performed the key components of this procedure including navigation, targeting, ablation, and post-procedure assessment.\n\n___________________________________________\nKevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nAssociate Professor of Medicine\nDirector of Advanced Bronchoscopy Fellowship\nDivision of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine\nStanford University School of Medicine\n\nCo-signed by:\nLisa Nguyen, MD (Pulmonary/Critical Care Fellow, PGY-6)\n\nProcedure dictated: [REDACTED] 16:45\nTranscribed: [REDACTED] 17:20\nElectronically authenticated: [REDACTED] 18:05"}

A 12 x 40 mm covered metal stent was visualized in the left mainstem bronchus with proximal migration and approximately 30–40% overhang into the distal trachea.\n\nUsing alligator forceps and a snare, the stent was carefully mobilized distally and re-centered in the left mainstem bronchus under direct visualization. No new stent was placed. Balloon dilation (10–12 mm) was performed within the existing stent to improve apposition to the airway wall.\n\nNo tumor debulking, mechanical destruction, laser or APC was performed; the intervention was limited to revision/repositioning of the pre-existing stent and balloon dilation inside the stent.\n\nFINDINGS:\n- Malignant-appearing narrowing at distal left mainstem with prior stent in place\n- Proximal stent migration successfully corrected with revision maneuvers\n\nSPECIMENS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None; mild mucosal oozing controlled with cold saline.\nDISPOSITION: Extubated in the OR, monitored in PACU then admitted to telemetry overnight."}

The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Carina, Left Carina (LC2), Right Mainstem, Left Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, RUL Carina (RC1), Trachea (Distal 1/3) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPCV\t14\t325\t11\t80\t5\t16\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 2.4mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3). Target lesion is approximately 27mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 0.6cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 8 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3). Instilled 40cc of NS, suction returned with 12cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Granulomatous inflammation\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nRodriguez, MD"}

Previous transthoracic needle biopsy performed on [REDACTED] yielded diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 positive, confirming primary lung origin.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: As above\n\nPROCEDURE(S) PERFORMED:\n1. Flexible bronchoscopy with complete airway survey\n2. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with real-time cone-beam CT guidance\n3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmation of target lesion\n4. Radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe peripheral nodule\n5. Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:\nThis is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.\n\nDETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:\nFollowing standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.\n\nAnesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.\n\nOlympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from [REDACTED] loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) id[REDACTED] and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.\n\nNavigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.\n\nCone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.\n\nExtended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90°C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds.

{"id": "2145069", "text": "OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE\nPART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)\nPatient [REDACTED] hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:\n\nCorrect patient (ID [REDACTED], verbal confirmation)\nProcedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)\nPositioning (supine throughout)\nAntibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)\nSteroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)\nBlood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)\n\nInitial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.\nInitial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:\nOlympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:\n\nSupraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions\nVocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses\nSubglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis\nTrachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions\nCarina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy\nLeft main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter\nLUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent\nRight main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.\n\nDecision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.\nRigid Bronchoscopy Phase:\nPatient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.\nVentilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.\nThe rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.\nMechanical Debridement:\nUsing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.\nEstimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue\nHemostasis Measures:\nAs expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:\n\nIced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.\nTopical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.\nTranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.\n\nAfter approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.\nElectrocautery:\nFlexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.\nTreatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus\nTreatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time\nEffect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis\nArgon Plasma Coagulation:\nAPC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.\nTreatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.\nDuration: 6 minutes active APC time\nResult: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface\nAssessment after debridement:\nRight mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.\nBalloon Dilation:\nBoston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.\nInflation sequence:\n\nFirst inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nSecond inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nThird inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)\n\nFluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.\nPost-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.\nStent Placement:\nAfter discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.\nStent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length\nDeployment technique:\n\nStent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance\nPositioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus\nFluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views\nSlow, controlled deployment under direct visualization\nPost-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion\n\nPost-stent assessment:\nFlexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.\nFindings:\n\nStent well-positioned, no migration\nExcellent apposition to airway walls\nRUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent\nRML orifice: Visible and patent\nRLL orifice: Visible and patent\nAll segments of right lung now visualized for first time\nSignificant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration:\nExtensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:\n\nRight upper lobe: Approximately 30mL\nRight middle lobe: Approximately 20mL\nRight lower lobe: Approximately 40mL\n\nTotal secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.\nFinal Airway Inspection:\n\nTrachea: Normal\nLeft bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent\nRight main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)\nRUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation\nMinimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent\n\nRigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).\nAirway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM\nEstimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL\nSpecimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)\n\nPART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)\nPatient [REDACTED] arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.\nTEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.\nSurgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):\n\nSubxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm\nDissection carried down to pericardium\nPericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created\nRush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid\nPericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)\nNo active bleeding from pericardial surface\n19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space\nDrain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction\n\nTEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.\n\nPART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)\nWith patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.\nUltrasound examination (performed by IP team):\n\nRight hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion\nEstimated volume: 1000-1200mL\nAnechoic fluid, no loculations\nCompressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)\n\nPleurX catheter placement:\nStandard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: [REDACTED]\nInitial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).\nChest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures.

The patient now has:\n\nRestored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)\nResolution of cardiac compromise\nControl of pleural effusion\n\nPrognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.\nThe patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT\nI, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement.

The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation) we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and has to convert to a 12mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.  Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.  It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression. Tumor debulking  was performed using APC to  “burn and shave” the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.\nOnce we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved. \nAfter measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position. Post-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery. \n\nRecommendations:\n-          Transfer back to ICU\n-          Post-procedure x-ray\n-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.\n-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified\n-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.\n-\tIf invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.\t\n\nMaya Ellington MD\nInterventional Pulmonology \nUniversity Medical Center Los Angeles"}
