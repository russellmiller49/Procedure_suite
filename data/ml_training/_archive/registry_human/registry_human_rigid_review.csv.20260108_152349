CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION
The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old [REDACTED] with a history of malignant airway obstruction. Progressive dyspnea with imaging showing airway compromise from tumor. Emergency intervention required.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: malignant airway obstruction

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis pending pathology results

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking

INFORMED CONSENT
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient demonstrated understanding and provided written informed consent.

ANESTHESIA
Type: Deep sedation
Medications: [REDACTED]
Airway: ETT with rigid

PROCEDURE DETAILS
Rigid bronchoscope was introduced under direct visualization. The endobronchial tumor was identified. Using a combination of mechanical debulking, electrocautery, and argon plasma coagulation, the tumor was progressively removed. Hemostasis was maintained throughout. The airway was restored to near-normal caliber.

FINDINGS
CAO intervention for RUL bronchus tumor. Pre-procedure 91% occluded. Multimodality debulking: mechanical, electrocautery, cryotherapy. Final result: 23% residual stenosis.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED
- Specimens sent to pathology per protocol
- Specimens labeled with patient identifiers and anatomic location
- Chain of custody maintained

COMPLICATIONS
None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: less than 5 mL

DISPOSITION
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. Patient will be monitored in the ICU overnight given the complexity of the procedure.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Successful tumor debulking with improved airway patency.

SURGEON: Mikie Gallegos, MD
ASSISTANT(s):  Stephen Pressly M.D., Nicholas Vance M.D,

NDICATIONS:  right middle lobe and right lower lobe stenosis
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
SEDATION: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.
Following intravenous medications as per the record, the endotracheal tube previously in place was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator.
Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle and right lower lobe bronchi were completely obstructed by granulation tissue and debris from previous bronchoscopy yesterday approximately 2 cm distal to orifice. There were small airway tears along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe and lateral aspect of right middle lobe assay where foreign body was extracted yesterday. With saline flushes we were able to bypass the obstruction in both the middle and lower lobe. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were developed with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps however as a result of chronicity of obstruction and inflammation the areas remain mostly obstructed requiring saline flushes to push through the area of obstruction.  Decision was made to place bronchial stents in hopes of reforming native airway orientation and to allow healing of airway tears. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and a thin disposable and the bronchoscope was inserted alongside an Aero 10 x 20 mm covered self-expandable metallic stent which was advanced over the guidewire and positioned within the right lower lobe bronchi and says obstruction based on direct visualization technique..  The stent was deployed however slightly distal. Attempts to retract the stent by grasping the proximal string were unsuccessful and it became obvious that the stent was oversized.  Using rigid forceps we are unable to remove the inappropriately sized stent and using a similar technique placed a 8 x 20 mm arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis.  Subsequently CRE balloon dilatation of the stent was performed and distal airways of the right lower lobe to include the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior segments were widely patent.  The superior segment was partially jailed.  Using a similar technique we then placed a 8 x 15 mm m arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis. In the right middle lobe.  Attention was taken to ensure that kissing stents did not result in obvious tissue necrosis or external compression of either airway.  The right middle lobe stent was then dilated using a CRE balloon and distal airways were widely patent. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.
RESULTS: Successful insertion of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi resulting in near complete recanalization of previously obstructed airways.
COMPLICATIONS: None
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- To PACU for recovery
- Admit to internal medicine wards overnight
- Initiate airway clearance regimen with nebulized 3% saline (3 mL) mixed with albuterol (2 mL) 3 times a day.
- Obtain post- procedural chest x-ray
- Plan to return to operating room in 2 weeks for stent removal

CLINICAL HISTORY & INDICATION
Mrs. [REDACTED] is a 65-year-old Nigerian-American female with a complex medical history including stage IIIB adenocarcinoma of the right lung (diagnosed 04/2023), status post chemoradiation therapy (completed 10/2023). She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:

Right mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from [REDACTED] shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung
Malignant pericardial effusion - Echo from [REDACTED] showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)
Right malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis [REDACTED] confirmed malignant cells

The patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic [REDACTED] with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.
MULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING
Pre-procedure conference held [REDACTED] with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:

Address airway obstruction first (most critical)
Follow with pericardial window creation
Complete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates

INFORMED CONSENT
Extensive discussion held with patient [REDACTED] (healthcare proxy) on [REDACTED] at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:

Bleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)
Perforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)
Arrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)
Hypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)
Need for ICU care postoperatively (expected)
Mortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)

Benefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.
Alternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).
Patient [REDACTED] understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.
