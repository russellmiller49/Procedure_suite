CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION
The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old [REDACTED] with a history of sarcoidosis. Recent CT imaging revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring tissue diagnosis for staging.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: sarcoidosis

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis pending pathology results

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)

INFORMED CONSENT
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient demonstrated understanding and provided written informed consent.

ANESTHESIA
Type: GA with LMA
Medications: [REDACTED]
Airway: ETT

PROCEDURE DETAILS
The EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT/LMA. Systematic examination of the mediastinum was performed. Lymph nodes were identified at multiple stations using ultrasound. Under real-time EBUS guidance, TBNA was performed using a 21-gauge needle. Multiple passes were obtained at each station with rapid on-site evaluation.

FINDINGS
Linear EBUS performed. Station 7 - 15mm node sampled x3 passes, ROSE positive for malignant cells. Station 10R - 17mm node sampled x3 passes, ROSE shows lymphocytes. Station 7 - 22mm node sampled x4 passes, ROSE adequate.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED
- FNA specimens to cytology; cell block prepared
- Specimens labeled with patient identifiers and anatomic location
- Chain of custody maintained

COMPLICATIONS
None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: less than 10 mL

DISPOSITION
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. The patient will be discharged home after meeting standard post-procedure criteria.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Mediastinal/hilar lymph node sampling completed. ROSE results as above; final pathology pending.

PLAN
1. Final pathology in 3-5 days. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion pending.
2. Results pending; will follow up with pathology
3. Return to clinic in [REDACTED] for follow-up
4. Call for fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis

CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION
The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old [REDACTED] with a history of mediastinal adenopathy. Recent CT imaging revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring tissue diagnosis for staging.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: mediastinal adenopathy

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis pending pathology results

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)

INFORMED CONSENT
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient demonstrated understanding and provided written informed consent.

ANESTHESIA
Type: Moderate sedation
Medications: [REDACTED]
Airway: LMA

PROCEDURE DETAILS
The EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT/LMA. Systematic examination of the mediastinum was performed. Lymph nodes were identified at multiple stations using ultrasound. Under real-time EBUS guidance, TBNA was performed using a 21-gauge needle. Multiple passes were obtained at each station with rapid on-site evaluation.

FINDINGS
Systematic EBUS staging performed. Stations sampled: 2R (16mm), 10L (16mm), 7 (25mm). ROSE available - 2R positive for adenocarcinoma, others negative for malignancy.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED
- FNA specimens to cytology; cell block prepared
- Specimens labeled with patient identifiers and anatomic location
- Chain of custody maintained

COMPLICATIONS
None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: none

DISPOSITION
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. The patient will be discharged home after meeting standard post-procedure criteria.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Mediastinal/hilar lymph node sampling completed. ROSE results as above; final pathology pending.

PLAN
1. Final pathology in 3-5 days. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion pending.
2. Results pending; will follow up with pathology
3. Return to clinic in [REDACTED] for follow-up
4. Call for fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis

Anesthesiologist: [REDACTED], MD
Nursing Staff: [REDACTED], RN
Respiratory Therapist: [REDACTED], RRT

CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION
The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old [REDACTED] with a history of malignant airway obstruction. Progressive dyspnea with imaging showing airway compromise from tumor. Emergency intervention required.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: malignant airway obstruction

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis pending pathology results

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking

INFORMED CONSENT
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient demonstrated understanding and provided written informed consent.

ANESTHESIA
Type: Deep sedation
Medications: [REDACTED]
Airway: ETT with rigid

PROCEDURE DETAILS
Rigid bronchoscope was introduced under direct visualization. The endobronchial tumor was identified. Using a combination of mechanical debulking, electrocautery, and argon plasma coagulation, the tumor was progressively removed. Hemostasis was maintained throughout. The airway was restored to near-normal caliber.

FINDINGS
CAO intervention for RUL bronchus tumor. Pre-procedure 91% occluded. Multimodality debulking: mechanical, electrocautery, cryotherapy. Final result: 23% residual stenosis.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED
- Specimens sent to pathology per protocol
- Specimens labeled with patient identifiers and anatomic location
- Chain of custody maintained

COMPLICATIONS
None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: less than 5 mL

DISPOSITION
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. Patient will be monitored in the ICU overnight given the complexity of the procedure.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Successful tumor debulking with improved airway patency.

PLAN
1. Close monitoring for re-obstruction. Repeat bronchoscopy as needed.
2. Results pending; will follow up with pathology
3. Return to clinic in [REDACTED] for follow-up
4. Call for fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis

FACILITY: [REDACTED]

CARE TEAM
Attending Physician: [REDACTED], MD - Interventional Pulmonology
Fellow: [REDACTED], MD - Pulmonary/Critical Care Fellow
Anesthesiologist: [REDACTED], MD
Nursing Staff: [REDACTED], RN
Respiratory Therapist: [REDACTED], RRT

CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION
The patient is a [REDACTED]-year-old [REDACTED] with a history of malignant airway obstruction. Progressive dyspnea with imaging showing airway compromise from tumor. Emergency intervention required.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: malignant airway obstruction

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis pending pathology results

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking

INFORMED CONSENT
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient demonstrated understanding and provided written informed consent.

ANESTHESIA
Type: Deep sedation
Medications: [REDACTED]
Airway: DLT

PROCEDURE DETAILS
Rigid bronchoscope was introduced under direct visualization. The endobronchial tumor was identified. Using a combination of mechanical debulking, electrocautery, and argon plasma coagulation, the tumor was progressively removed. Hemostasis was maintained throughout. The airway was restored to near-normal caliber.

FINDINGS
Rigid bronchoscopy revealed exophytic tumor in right mainstem causing 92% obstruction. Tumor debulking performed with electrocautery and mechanical coring. Post-procedure patency improved to 25% obstruction.

SPECIMENS OBTAINED
- Specimens sent to pathology per protocol
- Specimens labeled with patient identifiers and anatomic location
- Chain of custody maintained

COMPLICATIONS
None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: less than 5 mL

DISPOSITION
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. Patient will be monitored in the ICU overnight given the complexity of the procedure.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Successful tumor debulking with improved airway patency.

PLAN
1. Close monitoring for re-obstruction. Repeat bronchoscopy as needed.
2. Results pending; will follow up with pathology
3. Return to clinic in [REDACTED] for follow-up
4. Call for fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: malignant airway obstruction

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis pending pathology results

PROCEDURE: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia

INDICATIONS: This is a [REDACTED]-year-old patient with malignant airway obstruction who presents for rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in the supine position. General anesthesia was administered by anesthesia. The bronchoscope was introduced and advanced through the upper airway. A systematic examination was performed. The procedure was completed as planned.

Rigid bronchoscopy revealed exophytic tumor in left mainstem causing 85% obstruction. Tumor debulking performed with electrocautery and mechanical coring. Post-procedure patency improved to 14% obstruction.

The procedure was completed without immediate complication. None

The patient was awakened and transferred to recovery in stable condition.

SPECIMENS: Specimens sent to pathology per protocol

COMPLICATIONS: None

EBL: Minimal

DISPOSITION: Stable to recovery

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: respiratory failure from CAO

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis pending pathology results

PROCEDURE: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation

INDICATIONS: This is a [REDACTED]-year-old patient with respiratory failure from CAO who presents for rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in the supine position. Moderate sedation was administered by anesthesia. The bronchoscope was introduced and advanced through the upper airway. A systematic examination was performed. The procedure was completed as planned.

Rigid bronchoscopy revealed exophytic tumor in LLL bronchus causing 72% obstruction. Tumor debulking performed with electrocautery and mechanical coring. Post-procedure patency improved to 22% obstruction.

The procedure was completed without immediate complication. None

The patient was awakened and transferred to recovery in stable condition.

SPECIMENS: Specimens sent to pathology per protocol

COMPLICATIONS: None

"OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient underwent robotic-assisted navigational bronchoscopy for a 4cm RUL mass. Following therapeutic aspiration of secretions, the Ion platform was utilized to navigate to the anterior segment of the RUL. Localization was confirmed via Cone Beam CT (CBCT) and Radial EBUS. A diagnostic TBNA was performed. Subsequently, therapeutic microwave ablation was delivered to the lesion in three overlapping sessions (RB1, RB2, RB3) at 90 degrees Celsius to ensure adequate margins.

"INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
Patient: [REDACTED]  MRN: [REDACTED]  Age/Sex: 71/F
Date: [REDACTED]
Indication: Mid-tracheal endobronchial mass from adenoid cystic carcinoma with progressive dyspnea.
Procedure: Rigid bronchoscopy with mechanical debulking of tracheal tumor.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy; anesthesia team present.
Findings: Broad-based tracheal mass on posterior wall at T3 level causing ~70% lumen compromise; no distal involvement.
Intervention: Tumor was resected using rigid coring, snare resection of the bulk, and microdebrider to shave residual tissue. Multiple tumor fragments were removed and sent for histology. Final airway lumen showed approximately 20% residual narrowing without immediate need for stent.
Complications: Mild bleeding controlled with iced saline; no desaturation or pneumothorax.

Bronchus intermedius tumor with acute worsening dyspnea and wheeze. Rigid bronchoscopy with mechanical debulking of tumor. General anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy. Irregular friable tumor occupying ~85% of the bronchus intermedius lumen with distal mucous plugging. Tumor was cored out mechanically using the rigid barrel; large fragments were removed with suction and forceps. A microdebrider was used to excise residual tumor along the airway wall. Final lumen with ~30% residual narrowing; no stent was placed due to anticipated systemic therapy. Mild bleeding controlled with cold saline and topical epinephrine. Extubated in OR and admitted to oncology ward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,e290cc41285ffcf7 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     1 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0
"Navigational bronchoscopy with radiofrequency ablation of a peripheral right lower lobe nodule. 2.0 cm peripheral right lower lobe nodule, biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma. General anesthesia with endotracheal tube. A navigation catheter was advanced using CT-based virtual bronchoscopy planning to a superior segment right lower lobe target. Radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric image. A radiofrequency ablation catheter was then advanced. Three overlapping ablation cycles (each 50 W for 5 minutes) were delivered with careful monitoring of impedance and tip temperature. Post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated an ablation zone encompassing the nodule."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,91df3302c1d032fd ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          1 ,                        1 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  1 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0
"HISTORY: [REDACTED], a 72-year-old male with known squamous cell carcinoma, presented with critical central airway obstruction manifesting as stridor and dyspnea. Radiographic review confirmed significant distal tracheal stenosis.
OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient was inducted under general anesthesia with jet ventilation via rigid bronchoscopy. Examination revealed a circumferential, friable tumor obstructing 80% of the distal trachea. The lesion was mechanically debulked using the rigid barrel to re-establish patency. Subsequent balloon dilation was performed serially up to 14 mm. A 14 x 40 mm silicone tracheal stent was then deployed over a guidewire, seated approximately 2 cm proximal to the carina. Post-deployment inspection confirmed excellent radial expansion and restoration of the airway caliber.
DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close airway monitoring."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,e7f7b74ccdf41166 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     1 ,                   0 ,              1 ,           1 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

The procedure was performed under general anesthesia. A 12 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted. The right middle and lower lobes were obstructed by granulation tissue. Mechanical debulking was performed but obstruction persisted. We elected to place stents. An initial 10x20 mm stent in the RLL was oversized and replaced with an 8x20 mm covered metallic stent. A second 8x15 mm covered metallic stent was placed in the RML. Both were dilated with a CRE balloon. Final inspection showed patent airways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,343dcced6a51bdd4 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              1 ,           1 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

"Rigid bronchoscopy was performed for stent migration and tumor ingrowth. The patient was placed under general anesthesia. A 14mm rigid scope was used. The migrated silicone stent was retrieved from the right mainstem. Inspection showed 70% obstruction from tumor regrowth in the mid-trachea. This was treated with 40W Nd:YAG laser, mechanical coring, and 12mm balloon dilation. A new 16x50mm Dumon silicone stent was deployed. The airway was patent at the end of the case. EBL was 50cc."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,e5f84367c94d2a40 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   1 ,              1 ,           1 ,               1 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

NAME: [REDACTED]
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial obstruction

PROCEDURE(s) PERFORMED:
SURGEON: Mikie Gallegos, MD
ASSISTANT(s):  Stephen Pressly M.D., Nicholas Vance M.D,

NDICATIONS:  right middle lobe and right lower lobe stenosis
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
SEDATION: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.
Following intravenous medications as per the record, the endotracheal tube previously in place was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator.
Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle and right lower lobe bronchi were completely obstructed by granulation tissue and debris from previous bronchoscopy yesterday approximately 2 cm distal to orifice. There were small airway tears along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe and lateral aspect of right middle lobe assay where foreign body was extracted yesterday. With saline flushes we were able to bypass the obstruction in both the middle and lower lobe. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were developed with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps however as a result of chronicity of obstruction and inflammation the areas remain mostly obstructed requiring saline flushes to push through the area of obstruction.  Decision was made to place bronchial stents in hopes of reforming native airway orientation and to allow healing of airway tears. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and a thin disposable and the bronchoscope was inserted alongside an Aero 10 x 20 mm covered self-expandable metallic stent which was advanced over the guidewire and positioned within the right lower lobe bronchi and says obstruction based on direct visualization technique..  The stent was deployed however slightly distal. Attempts to retract the stent by grasping the proximal string were unsuccessful and it became obvious that the stent was oversized.  Using rigid forceps we are unable to remove the inappropriately sized stent and using a similar technique placed a 8 x 20 mm arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis.  Subsequently CRE balloon dilatation of the stent was performed and distal airways of the right lower lobe to include the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior segments were widely patent.  The superior segment was partially jailed.  Using a similar technique we then placed a 8 x 15 mm m arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis. In the right middle lobe.  Attention was taken to ensure that kissing stents did not result in obvious tissue necrosis or external compression of either airway.  The right middle lobe stent was then dilated using a CRE balloon and distal airways were widely patent. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.
RESULTS: Successful insertion of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi resulting in near complete recanalization of previously obstructed airways.
COMPLICATIONS: None
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- To PACU for recovery
- Admit to internal medicine wards overnight
- Initiate airway clearance regimen with nebulized 3% saline (3 mL) mixed with albuterol (2 mL) 3 times a day.
- Obtain post- procedural chest x-ray
- Plan to return to operating room in 2 weeks for stent removal

"INDICATION: Evaluation and treatment of a PET-avid peripheral RUL nodule in a non-surgical candidate.
PROCEDURE: Electromagnetic navigation was utilized to cannulate the posterior segment of the RUL. Radial EBUS confirmed a concentric lesion signature. Following verification via cone-beam CT, microwave ablation was delivered (65W/7min). Post-procedural imaging confirmed an adequate ablation zone encompassing the target with circumferential margins.
IMPRESSION: Successful bronchoscopic microwave ablation of RUL malignancy."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,357fb20a156e17c5 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          1 ,                        1 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  1 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0
"Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note
Procedure: Navigational bronchoscopy with microwave ablation of a peripheral right upper lobe nodule.
Indication: 2.1 cm PET-avid peripheral right upper lobe nodule in a patient with presumed early-stage non-small cell lung cancer who is a poor surgical candidate.
Patient: 74-year-old female with COPD and coronary artery disease.
Sedation/airway: General anesthesia with endotracheal tube.
Procedure description: Following induction of general anesthesia and ETT placement, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced and the tracheobronchial tree inspected. Using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, a steerable catheter was guided to a posterior segment right upper lobe peripheral target along a planned pathway. Radial EBUS was then deployed through the extended working channel, demonstrating a concentric ultrasound signal consistent with an in-lesion position. After confirming catheter position with cone-beam CT, the radial EBUS probe was removed and a microwave ablation catheter was advanced to the lesion. A single ablation cycle was performed at 65 W for 7 minutes. Real-time impedance changes and post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated an ablation zone encompassing the nodule with at least a 5 mm circumferential margin. The catheter and bronchoscope were removed. No biopsies or lavage were performed during this session.
Findings: Posterior segment right upper lobe peripheral nodule successfully targeted and treated with bronchoscopic microwave ablation; no endobronchial tumor in central airways.

"Navigational bronchoscopy with cryoablation of a peripheral left lower lobe nodule. 1.4 cm peripheral left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. General anesthesia with endotracheal tube. Using CT-based navigational bronchoscopy, a steerable catheter was guided to a lateral basal segment left lower lobe target. Radial EBUS confirmed a concentric image. A dedicated endobronchial cryoprobe was advanced. Three freeze–thaw cycles were performed (10-minute freeze followed by passive thaw). Cone-beam CT after the final cycle demonstrated an ice ball encompassing the nodule with appropriate margins."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,c66ce426b5388fa0 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          1 ,                        1 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          1 ,   0 ,                  1 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

"INDICATION: Evaluation of hilar adenopathy.
PROCEDURE: General anesthesia was utilized. Initial airway inspection via LMA necessitated repositioning of the airway device. Examination revealed normal bronchial anatomy but significant tenacious greenish secretions which were cleared. EBUS examination of the left upper lobe revealed a 10mm hypoechoic, septated structure at station 10L. Transbronchial needle aspiration was initiated with a 22G needle yielding serous fluid, consistent with a cyst. A 19G needle was subsequently employed to evacuate 3cc of fluid, resulting in sonographic resolution of the cyst. Three additional passes were performed for cytology. ROSE demonstrated lymphocytes.
CONCLUSION: Aspiration of 10L hilar cyst."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,1d2e0eee659985af ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          1 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

"The patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite and placed under general anesthesia. Initial inspection required therapeutic aspiration of the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem to clear mucus. A therapeutic scope was advanced to the RML lateral segment. Radial EBUS confirmed a concentric lesion. TBNA (19G/21G) and TBBX (forceps) were performed obtaining 6 samples each, followed by BAL. ROSE confirmed malignancy. Linear EBUS was then utilized for staging. Lymph node stations 11L, 7, and 11Rs were sampled using a 22G needle under elastographic guidance. The patient tolerated the procedure well."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,0168a5eb6843bec1 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  1 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                1 ,          1 ,          1 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     1 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

"[REDACTED] for evaluation of lung infiltrates. We noted nodular mucosal changes and performed endobronchial biopsies at multiple carinas. A bronchoalveolar lavage was conducted in the right middle lobe. We then directed our attention to the left lower lobe, using radial EBUS to guide transbronchial biopsies. Finally, we performed EBUS staging, sampling the subcarinal node (station 7) while inspecting other stations which did not require biopsy."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,6112f96f9adf2c29 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  1 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                1 ,          1 ,          1 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

michael foster case. did ebus first found cancer in 4r and 7. then went to the lul mass and biopsied that too. got good samples. bit of bleeding but stopped it with epi. looks like n2 disease. tumor board next week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,cc2e8b3599ead912 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                1 ,          1 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0
"OPERATIVE SUMMARY: The patient presented for management of central airway obstruction. Inspection revealed a patent RML stent but significant (90%) malignant obstruction involving the distal trachea, right mainstem, and left mainstem bronchi. Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) was utilized to ablate the endobronchial tumor tissue. Post-treatment inspection confirmed restoration of 100% airway patency. Additionally, therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucous secretions from the bronchial tree."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,5c7d0e70d5179486 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     1 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               1 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

"We performed a rigid bronchoscopy on [REDACTED] a tumor obstructing his bronchus intermedius. The blockage was approximately 74%. We used rigid biopsy forceps to mechanically excise the tumor tissue piece by piece. We continued this until the obstruction was reduced to 12%. The bleeding was controlled, and we collected sufficient samples for pathology. He was transferred to the ICU for recovery."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,c4aea40df43ea155 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     1 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0
"PROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy with Tumor Debulking and Stenting.
INDICATION: Malignant obstruction of the Bronchus Intermedius (BI) with post-obstructive pneumonia.
NARRATIVE: General anesthesia was induced. A 12mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted. Jet ventilation proved inadequate due to hypoxia, necessitating conversion to a closed system with conventional ventilation. Inspection revealed a fleshy, obstructive tumor in the proximal BI with distal purulence. Thermal ablation was contraindicated due to high FiO2. We performed mechanical coring and cryo-extraction to recanalize the airway. Copious purulent secretions were evacuated. An Aero 20x10mm covered metallic stent was deployed over a guidewire under fluoroscopic control. Post-deployment inspection confirmed patency of the RUL, RML, and RLL orifices."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,2490785de4147cd9 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           1 ,               0 ,          1 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

"OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient presented with complete malignant stenosis of the Left Mainstem (LMS) bronchus. Rigid bronchoscopy was initiated under general anesthesia. The obstruction was recanalized using a combination of cryoextraction and Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) 'burn and shave' techniques. Due to significant residual tumor burden and the risk of re-occlusion, a decision was made to deploy a stent. A 12x40mm Aero Self-Expanding Metallic Stent (SEMS) was positioned under fluoroscopic guidance, achieving >90% luminal patency."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,00798ddc6a87d9ba ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           1 ,               1 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

"Due to severe compression of the trachea from the outside, we performed a rigid bronchoscopy to place a stent. We measured the airways and cut a silicone Y-stent to fit. We deployed the stent to hold the trachea and main airways open. The patient's breathing improved immediately after placement. We confirmed the stent was in a good position before finishing."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,b042af2588d496aa ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           1 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

"We performed a bronchoscopy to investigate the patient's chronic cough. Upon entering the airways, we noted significant inflammation, with boggy, erythematous mucosa and thick purulent secretions scattered throughout. We washed the right lower lobe and performed a formal lavage of the right middle lobe. These samples were submitted for extensive microbiological testing to rule out opportunistic infection."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,8e7d105193e8f6fa ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  1 ,             1 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

PROCEDURE: Rigid bronchoscopy revealed the Ultraflex stent extending into the distal trachea. Using rigid forceps, the prosthesis was mobilized. It was successfully repositioned distally into the left mainstem bronchus. Airway patency was fully restored, and the stent is now seated appropriately."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,01c5781f64b75007 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0
Moderate sedation with propofol was used. Multiple violaceous raised plaques consistent with Kaposi sarcoma were noted in the trachea and bilateral mainstems. Biopsies were taken from the RMS and LMS. A bronchial wash was performed in the LLL. The patient tolerated the procedure well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,c5208ebec8fb3606 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             1 ,        0 ,                   1 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   0 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          0 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 0 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0

CLINICAL HISTORY & INDICATION
Mrs. [REDACTED] is a 65-year-old Nigerian-American female with a complex medical history including stage IIIB adenocarcinoma of the right lung (diagnosed 04/2023), status post chemoradiation therapy (completed 10/2023). She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:

Right mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from [REDACTED] shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung
Malignant pericardial effusion - Echo from [REDACTED] showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)
Right malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis [REDACTED] confirmed malignant cells

The patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic [REDACTED] with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.
MULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING
Pre-procedure conference held [REDACTED] with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:

Address airway obstruction first (most critical)
Follow with pericardial window creation
Complete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates

INFORMED CONSENT
Extensive discussion held with patient [REDACTED] (healthcare proxy) on [REDACTED] at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:

Bleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)
Perforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)
Arrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)
Hypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)
Need for ICU care postoperatively (expected)
Mortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)

Benefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.
Alternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).
Patient [REDACTED] understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.

A 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth. The patient’s Y stent was well placed. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optic was reinserted alongside rigid alligator forceps. The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope. Once his stent was removed an I-gel LMA was then placed. The cryotherapy probe was used to perform multiple 30 second freeze thaw cycles at the areas of residual granulation tissue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,5bfb6e2d5a5d9138 ,registry_unlabeled_notes.jsonl ,human        ,             1.0 ,registry_v1     ,                      1 ,  0 ,             0 ,        0 ,                   0 ,                0 ,          0 ,          0 ,                        0 ,                    0 ,                        0 ,                     0 ,                   1 ,              0 ,           0 ,               0 ,          1 ,   0 ,                  0 ,                     0 ,                0 ,                 1 ,            0 ,         0 ,  0 ,                   0 ,          0 ,             0 ,                   0
