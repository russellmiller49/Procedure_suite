There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle and right lower lobe bronchi were completely obstructed by granulation tissue and debris from previous bronchoscopy yesterday approximately 2 cm distal to orifice. There were small airway tears along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe and lateral aspect of right middle lobe assay where foreign body was extracted yesterday. With saline flushes we were able to bypass the obstruction in both the middle and lower lobe. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were developed with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps however as a result of chronicity of obstruction and inflammation the areas remain mostly obstructed requiring saline flushes to push through the area of obstruction.  Decision was made to place bronchial stents in hopes of reforming native airway orientation and to allow healing of airway tears. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and a thin disposable and the bronchoscope was inserted alongside an Aero 10 x 20 mm covered self-expandable metallic stent which was advanced over the guidewire and positioned within the right lower lobe bronchi and says obstruction based on direct visualization technique..  The stent was deployed however slightly distal. Attempts to retract the stent by grasping the proximal string were unsuccessful and it became obvious that the stent was oversized.  Using rigid forceps we are unable to remove the inappropriately sized stent and using a similar technique placed a 8 x 20 mm arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis.  Subsequently CRE balloon dilatation of the stent was performed and distal airways of the right lower lobe to include the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior segments were widely patent.  The superior segment was partially jailed.  Using a similar technique we then placed a 8 x 15 mm m arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis. In the right middle lobe.  Attention was taken to ensure that kissing stents did not result in obvious tissue necrosis or external compression of either airway.  The right middle lobe stent was then dilated using a CRE balloon and distal airways were widely patent. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.\nRESULTS: Successful insertion of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi resulting in near complete recanalization of previously obstructed airways.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- To PACU for recovery\n- Admit to internal medicine wards overnight\n- Initiate airway clearance regimen with nebulized 3% saline (3 mL) mixed with albuterol (2 mL) 3 times a day.\n- Obtain post- procedural chest x-ray\n- Plan to return to operating room in 2 weeks for stent removal\n\nMikie Gallegos MD\nInterventional Pulmonology\nTulsa Medical Center", "cats": {"diagnostic_bronchoscopy": 1, "bal": 0, "bronchial_wash": 0, "brushings": 0, "endobronchial_biopsy": 0, "tbna_conventional": 0, "linear_ebus": 0, "radial_ebus": 0, "navigational_bronchoscopy": 0, "transbronchial_biopsy": 0, "transbronchial_cryobiopsy": 0, "therapeutic_aspiration": 0, "foreign_body_removal": 0, "airway_dilation": 1, "airway_stent": 1, "thermal_ablation": 0, "tumor_debulking_non_thermal": 1, "cryotherapy": 0, "blvr": 0, "peripheral_ablation": 0, "bronchial_thermoplasty": 0, "whole_lung_lavage": 0, "rigid_bronchoscopy": 1, "thoracentesis": 0, "chest_tube": 0, "ipc": 0, "medical_thoracoscopy": 0, "pleurodesis": 0, "pleural_biopsy": 0, "fibrinolytic_therapy": 0}, "_view_id": "textcat", "meta": {"source_csv": "data/ml_training/registry_human_v1_backup.csv", "filter_labels": ["rigid_bronchoscopy", "rigid_bronchoscopy"], "encounter_id": "b377f23b0530ad84 "}}
