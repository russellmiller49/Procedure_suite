"Patient Name: John M. Anderson
MRN: 8472-9315
DOB: 03/15/1958 (Age: 67)
Date of Procedure: 10/12/2025
Institution: Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA
Attending Physician: Dr. Sarah Chen, MD, FCCP
Fellow: Dr. Michael Rodriguez, MD
Anesthesia: Dr. Patricia Williams, MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.3 cm, highly suspicious for primary lung adenocarcinoma. Patient deemed high surgical risk due to severe COPD (FEV1 38% predicted) and coronary artery disease with prior CABG.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Bronchoscopic electromagnetic navigation with microwave ablation of right upper lobe peripheral nodule

INDICATION:
67-year-old gentleman with 45 pack-year smoking history presents with incidentally discovered 2.3 cm spiculated nodule in right upper lobe posterior segment. PET-CT demonstrates SUV max 8.4. Transthoracic needle biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Patient evaluated by thoracic surgery but deemed prohibitive surgical risk. Multidisciplinary tumor board recommended bronchoscopic ablation vs SBRT. Patient elected for bronchoscopic microwave ablation after extensive discussion of risks and benefits.

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
After informed consent, patient brought to interventional pulmonology suite. Time-out performed. General anesthesia induced with propofol and rocuronium, patient intubated with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope advanced through ETT after securing airway. Initial survey bronchoscopy revealed patent airways without endobronchial lesions. 

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy performed using superDimension system with prior thin-slice CT protocol. Planning software identified target nodule in RUL posterior segment (RB1). Navigation successful with 8 steerable guide sheath advanced to peripheral location. Radial EBUS performed demonstrating target lesion in contact position with characteristic hypoechoic appearance. Target confirmed with cone-beam CT showing guide sheath within 5mm of lesion center.

Extended working channel passed through guide sheath. Microwave ablation probe (Emprint 2.0, 15mm active tip) advanced through EWC to target site. Ablation parameters: 65 watts, 5 minute duration. Temperature monitoring showed gradual rise to 85°C at probe tip. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation. Post-ablation radial EBUS demonstrated hyperechoic changes consistent with coagulative necrosis. 

Guide sheath slowly withdrawn under direct visualization. Inspection revealed mild mucosal edema but no active bleeding. Airways suctioned clear. Patient emerged from anesthesia without complications. Extubated in suite and transferred to PACU in stable condition.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal
FLUIDS: 800 mL crystalloid
COMPLICATIONS: None
SPECIMENS: None sent

FINDINGS:
1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RUL posterior segment target
2. Microwave ablation completed per protocol with good real-time monitoring
3. Post-ablation imaging confirms appropriate zone of coagulation

PLAN:
1. Admit for overnight observation
2. Chest CT with contrast in 6 hours to assess for complications
3. Pain control with scheduled acetaminophen and PRN oxycodone
4. Incentive spirometry q2h while awake
5. Follow-up CT chest in 6 weeks to assess treatment response
6. Close PET-CT surveillance at 3, 6, and 12 months

DISPOSITION: Admitted to 7 West pulmonary intermediate care

DATE OF PROCEDURE: 5/15/2019
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: left mainstem stent obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
Distal granulation tissue causing left lower lobe obstruction
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with cryodebulking/cryotherapy of obstructive granulation tissue, endobronchial submucosal steroid injection, left mainstem bronchial stent removal
SURGEON: Jordan Parks , MD 
ASSISTANT: Michael Manson DO (fellow), 
INDICATIONS: complete lobar collapse  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea and right sided airways were normal. The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of stent obstruction.  At the distal edge of the stent there was some minor granulation tissue which was nonobstructive.  Distal to the stent there was complete obstruction of the left lower lobe orifice secondary to granulation tissue.  Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract granulation tissue to visualize the segmental stenosis in the left lower lobe.  All of the segments were obstructed with granulation tissue as well which we also removed with cryotherapy as well as flexible forceps.  At this point we decided to remove the left mainstem stent for a few reasons.  The first is that pathology from previous bronchoscopy at time of stent placement did not show evidence of tumor and metallic stents are not advised for benign disease.  The second was that her new obstruction was secondary to distal granulation tissue and it was unclear whether the stent was providing any current benefit.  Finally, our hope was that the short-term placement of the stent allowed some remodeling of the airway to relieve the previous obstruction.  At this point the LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway.  Using flexible forceps to grasp the proximal string on the stent we were able to gently retract the stent and remove it without difficulty.  Subsequently they flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and as we had hoped the orifice had remodeled and essentially there is no obstruction at the level of the previous stent.  At the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.  Then, using a 8–9–10 millimeter CRE balloon dilated each of the left lower lobe subsegments as well as the left lower lobe main bronchus which improved patency of the subsegments to approximately 50% of normal and left lower lobe bronchus to approximately 80%.  Cryotherapy was then performed with 30 second freeze/thaw cycles to induce tissue sloughing.  Finally using the super dimension 21-gauge needle we injected a total of 5 mL of Kenalog 10 mg/milliliter solution into the submucosa have areas of significant granulation tissue in hopes of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect to prevent regrowth of granulation tissue. 
Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. 
Recommendations:
-        Transfer patient back to the ICU
-        Post-procedure x-ray
-        Patient to follow-up with me for repeat bronchoscopy in about a week to remove debris post cryotherapy as well as to assess for evidence of restenosis.

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to percutaneous tracheostomy were discussed with the patient's wife (patient sedated). Surrogate indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was obtained.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prolonged mechanical ventilation; ARDS
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Tracheostomy, Planned (Percutaneous, Bronchoscopic Assistance) (CPT 31600)
ATTENDING: Dr. Jennifer Taylor
ASSISTANT: Dr. Mark Stevens, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Amanda White
RT: Christopher Lee

ANESTHESIA: Propofol and Fentanyl infusions (patient already intubated and sedated)
MONITORING: ICU monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, arterial line, telemetry
INSTRUMENT: Olympus bronchoscope, Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous tracheostomy kit, 8.0 Shiley cuffed tracheostomy tube
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine with neck extension (shoulder roll)
The bronchoscope was introduced through the existing 8.0 ETT into the trachea. The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized and counted.
With bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck for local anesthesia. A 1cm vertical skin incision was made with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.
A syringe with 1% Lidocaine was attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings into the trachea under direct visualization. Aspiration of air confirmed tracheal entry. The needle was removed and the 18-gauge introducer catheter over needle was advanced into this position under direct visualization.
The inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place. A J-wire was passed through the catheter, visualized with the bronchoscope entering the tracheal lumen. The site was dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.
The 14Fr dilator was removed and an 8Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. The Blue Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter and advanced until the positioning mark (corresponding to 8.0 trach size) was visualized via the bronchoscope between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings.
The Blue Rhino dilator was removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
Finally, a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically with the tip approximately 3cm above the carina.
The endotracheal tube was removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. End-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed appropriate ventilation. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding. A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place with 2-0 nylon sutures.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. The staff physician, Dr. Taylor, was present throughout the entire procedure.

Indication: Multiple pulmonary nodules - dominant lesion biopsy
Target: 11mm nodule in Lingula

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, Left Carina (LC2), RUL Carina (RC1) from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	295	12	80	5	22

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 2.1mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Lingula (LB4). Target lesion is approximately 11mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.7cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.

Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

ROSE Result: No evidence of malignant neoplasm

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

Procedure Name: Medical Thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy)
Patient Name: Maizie Booth
Patient MRN: 34329024
Indications: Right sided Pleural effusion
Medications: As per anesthesia record
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the left lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  An 8 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 1600cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had diffuse carcinomatosis with multiple hard white pleural nodules covering the parietal and visceral pleura.  No adhesions were present Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 12 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, the pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly.
Complications: None
The patient tolerated the procedural well.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed mild post-procedural subcutaneous air with full lung re-expansion and IPC in place
Estimated Blood Loss: 15cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion 
Recommendation:
Will await pathology and microbiological studies
Patient education on pleural catheter draining and will next week for initial drainage.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.         Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation
SURGEON: Aria Winslow, MD
ASSISTANT: Owen Mallory MD
INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.
Recommendations: 
•	Transfer patient back to ward room 
•	Await final pathology results  
•	Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.

The right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to identify the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.
ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract
Entry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space
Location: Mid-axillary line
Procedure Steps:

A finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038"" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.
Two 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.
The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.
Serial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.
The guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).
The introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).
The catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.
Sterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).

Diode laser system: 630nm wavelength
Light dosimetry calculation performed pre-procedure

DETAILED PROCEDURE NARRATIVE
The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, a time-out was performed verifying correct patient, procedure, and photosensitizer administration timing.
Initial Bronchoscopic Survey:
The bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic examination revealed:

Upper airways: Normal
Trachea: Patent, no lesions
Carina: Sharp, normal
Right bronchial tree: Entirely normal, no endobronchial lesions
Left bronchial tree: Endobronchial tumor visible in left mainstem bronchus

Tumor Characteristics (Pre-PDT measurements):

Location: Left mainstem bronchus, 2cm distal to carina on medial wall
Size: 1.8cm (longitudinal) × 0.9cm (circumferential extent)
Morphology: Flat, slightly raised plaque-like lesion
Color: Pink-red with areas of white keratinization
Surface: Irregular, slightly friable appearance
Obstruction: Approximately 30% luminal narrowing
Distal airways: LUL and LLL fully patent

Photodynamic Therapy Light Delivery:
Laser safety protocols confirmed (room signage, protective eyewear, fire safety measures in place). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The fiber was positioned to center the tumor within the treatment field. Distance measurements confirmed using bronchoscope markings.
Treatment Parameters:

Wavelength: 630 nm (red laser light, optimal for Photofrin activation)
Power output: 400 mW/cm of diffuser length
Diffuser length: 2.5 cm
Total power: 1000 mW (1.0 W)
Light dose (fluence): 200 J/cm² of diffuser surface
Treatment time: 500 seconds (8 minutes 20 seconds)
Calculation: 200 J/cm² ÷ 0.4 W/cm = 500 seconds

Light was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:

Laser energy meter verified consistent power output
No visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)
No charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)
Patient hemodynamically stable throughout
No arrhythmias or desaturations

Post-Treatment Assessment:
Immediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.
Light Precautions Review:
Post-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:

Strict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum
Wear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors
Gradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing
Emergency contact information provided
Written instructions given

The patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.
SPECIMENS
None (non-excisional therapy)
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
This 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven 9/15/2024) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.
Timeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:

Scheduled debridement bronchoscopy: October 14, 2024 (48 hours post-light)
Anticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal
Will assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed

Ongoing Management:

Continue light precautions (patient education reinforced)
Monitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions
Dexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)
PPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)
Debridement session in 2 days

Long-term surveillance:
Bronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.
Procedure Note - EBV Removal

Indication: Patient had Zephyr valves placed in RUL 6 months ago for emphysema. Developed recurrent pneumonias and productive cough. Decision made to remove valves.
Patient brought to OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.
Valve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.
Valve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.
Valve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.
After valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.
Left lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.
Specimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.
Follow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve. Will see in clinic 2 weeks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RUSHED TO BEDSIDE
Arrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.
SCOPE FINDINGS:
ETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.
RIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal
LEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.
INITIAL MEASURES:

Iced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope
Some temporary improvement but bleeding continues
Epi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect
Tranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction

BALLOON TAMPONADE:
Blood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.
Kept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.
Second deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.
FINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:
After tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.
SPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)
PLAN:

ICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)
Keep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning
Reverse any coagulopathy (check labs)
CTA chest to identify bleeding vessel
IR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am
I'll be on standby if rebleeds before IR
If rebleeds: will place endobronchial blocker to LUL for longer-term isolation

Supervising: Dr. Marcus Williams, MD, FCCP
Anesthesia: Dr. Sandra Lopez, MD

CASE SUMMARY:
69-year-old woman with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency emphysema (PiZZ genotype), lower lobe predominant disease pattern.

TEACHING POINTS REVIEWED PRE-PROCEDURE:
1. Alpha-1 patients often have basilar predominant disease (unlike smoking-related emphysema)
2. Valve selection sizing based on CT measurements  
3. Chartis interpretation and decision-making
4. Complete vs. incomplete fissure implications

PRE-PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:
☑ Consent obtained and witnessed
☑ Sedation plan reviewed with anesthesia
☑ CT images loaded on workstation
☑ Valves available (multiple sizes)
☑ Chartis system prepared and tested
☑ Fluoroscopy operational
☑ Emergency equipment checked

PROCEDURE WALKTHROUGH:

STEP 1: Airway Assessment
Fellow performed systematic examination with attending supervision. Appropriate technique demonstrated for complete inspection.

STEP 2: Chartis Assessment  
Target: Left Lower Lobe
- Catheter advanced to LLL
- Balloon inflated to create seal at LLL orifice
- Baseline flow and resistance measured
- Results: Flow decay to <30mL/min = NEGATIVE CV
Teaching point: This indicates absent collateral ventilation and favorable for valve therapy

STEP 3: Bronchial Measurement & Valve Selection
CT-based measurements reviewed:
- LB6: 6.8mm diameter → 5.5mm valve selected
- LB8-10: 5.2mm diameter → 4.0mm valve selected

STEP 4: Valve Deployment (Fellow performed with guidance)
- First valve (LB6): Required repositioning due to initial incomplete seal. Good learning opportunity regarding deployment technique.
- Second valve (LB8-10): Successful first attempt with excellent technique
- Final bronchoscopy: Both valves well-positioned, complete occlusion confirmed

TEACHING POINTS POST-PROCEDURE:
1. Valve repositioning is common and not a complication
2. Visual confirmation of complete lobar occlusion is essential
3. Post-procedure care including steroid/antibiotic prophylaxis rationale
4. Expected timeline for symptom improvement (4-6 weeks typically)

FELLOW ASSESSMENT:
Demonstrated good procedural skills. Area for improvement: Pre-deployment assessment of valve orientation. Overall: Progressing well in BLVR competency.

PATIENT OUTCOME: Tolerated well, stable, admitted for observation per protocol.

"BRONCHOSCOPY REPORT - BLVR PROCEDURE
April 22, 2024

Patient: William ""Bill"" Anderson | DOB: 02/14/1956 | MRN: 87654321
Institution: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH
Physician: Sarah Kim, MD | Fellow: Michael Chang, MD

Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with end-stage COPD who presented for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. His emphysema is predominantly in the left upper lobe with CT demonstrating 85% destruction and essentially complete fissural integrity at 98%. 

After discussing risks and benefits, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. Monitoring included continuous pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and cardiac telemetry. Moderate sedation was achieved with appropriate medications.

Using a flexible bronchoscope, I entered through the mouth and performed a systematic evaluation of the entire tracheobronchial tree. The vocal cords were normal. The trachea and carina appeared unremarkable. Both mainstem bronchi were patent. Moving to the left upper lobe, I noted the characteristic changes of severe emphysema.

I proceeded with Chartis assessment of the LUL which demonstrated absent collateral ventilation - an ideal finding for valve placement. Subsequently, I placed four Zephyr endobronchial valves: one 5.5mm valve in the lingular segments, and three 4.0mm valves in the upper division bronchi. Each valve was carefully sized and positioned to ensure complete occlusion without migration risk.

The patient tolerated the procedure remarkably well without complications. Post-procedure imaging confirmed appropriate valve positioning and early signs of target lobe volume reduction.

Date: 02/21/2025
Patient: Donald ""Don"" Peterson | DOB: 11/22/1957 | Age: 67 | MRN: 89012356
Institution: Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN
Physician: Dr. Catherine Sullivan, MD | Assistant: Anna Martinez, RNFA

Indication: Valve migration and incomplete lobar occlusion

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient underwent initial BLVR with RUL valve placement 8 weeks ago (performed by Dr. Sullivan) with good initial response (FEV1 improved from 32% to 41% predicted). However, repeat CT at 6 weeks showed migration of RB2 valve with incomplete occlusion. Patient noted return of dyspnea over past 2 weeks.

IMAGING REVIEW:
Comparison CT demonstrates:
- RB1 valve: Excellent position, maintained
- RB2 valve: Migrated distally approximately 1.5cm  
- RB3 valve: Excellent position, maintained
- Result: Incomplete RUL occlusion with air flow to anterior segment

PROCEDURE PLAN: Bronchoscopic valve repositioning/replacement

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Flexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation. Original anatomy reviewed. 

FINDINGS:
- RB1 and RB3 valves well-seated as expected
- RB2 valve visible but clearly malpositioned in subsegmental bronchus
- Surrounding granulation tissue present

INTERVENTION:
Using specialized removal forceps, the migrated RB2 valve was carefully grasped at the retention hooks. Gentle rotational torque applied while maintaining steady traction. Valve successfully removed intact without mucosal injury.

Bronchus re-inspected: Mild granulation tissue at original deployment site. Conservative debridement performed with cytology brush.

NEW VALVE PLACEMENT:
After measuring, new 5.5mm Zephyr valve (one size larger than original 4.0mm) deployed in RB2 with improved wall contact and resistance to migration. Valve delivery system technique modified to ensure more proximal placement.

CONFIRMATION:
Final bronchoscopy confirmed all three valves in excellent position with complete RUL occlusion. No air flow detected.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Successful removal of migrated EBV
2. Successful replacement with larger valve
3. Complete RUL occlusion restored
4. No complications

PLAN:
- Outpatient procedure, observe 4 hours then discharge
- Continue prophylactic antibiotics x 5 days  
- Repeat CT in 6 weeks
- Close follow-up given history of migration

"Procedure Name: Medical Thoracoscopy (Pleuroscopy)
DoD ID: 117657391
Name: Ortiez, Ilene
Date: 6/11/2024
Proceduralist(s): Timothy Lundred, MD
Assistant: Katherine Smith, MD (Fellows)
Indications: Malignant Pleural Effusion requiring additional tissue for molecular analysis
Medications: Fentanyl 150 mcg, Midazolam 3 mg, Lidocaine (topical) 300 mg
CPT Codes: 32609 Thoracoscopy; with biopsy(ies) of pleura
Procedural Details:
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position, and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by ultrasound in the left 8th rib space. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.
An 18-gauge, 5 cm long echogenic percutaneous entry needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space, and fluid was aspirated to verify placement. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the needle, and the needle was then withdrawn. A 1.5 cm incision was made through the skin, and a 14 Fr dilator was advanced into the pleural space over the wire.
The dilator was removed, and gentle dissection with Kelly forceps was performed alongside the wire until the pleural space was entered. A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 8th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid, resulting in the removal of approximately 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space.
The pleura had diffuse carcinomatosis, and thick adhesions were present with tethering of the lung to the chest wall. The 5 mm port was removed, and an 8 mm port was inserted in the same fashion through the original entry point. Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture, with approximately five total biopsies taken. There was mild bleeding associated with the biopsies. An additional 375 cc of sanguineous fluid was then removed with suction applied through the port. Repeat examination of the pleural space showed residual bleeding had subsided.
The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the port, and the port was withdrawn. A 14 Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain and pigtail straightening obturator were inserted into the pleural space over the wire. The obturator and wire were removed, and the drain was then immediately connected to a Pleur-Evac via the connecting tubing adapter. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and tidaling. The incision was then sutured into place with subcuticular 0 silk suture. Once the air leak had subsided, a chest X-ray was performed, which showed lung re-expansion. The chest tube was then removed, and the site was dressed with Steri-Strips, gauze, and Tegaderm.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed lung re-expansion and minimal residual effusion.
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 20 cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion
Specimens:
•        Pleural fluid- 1275 cc (sent for cytology and microbiological analysis)
•        Pleural biopsies- 5 (sent for pathology and culture)
Recommendation:
•        Await pathology and microbiological studies.
•        Suture removal in 2 weeks.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal cancer with extrinsic compression of left mainstem bronchus
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Resolved mainstem obstruction s/p areo stent 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with Aero tracheobronchial stent placement in the left mainstem
SURGEON: Racheal Chung , MD 
ASSISTANT: Jenny Smith MD (fellow)
INDICATIONS: extrinsic compression of left mainstem bronchus
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. The left vocal cord was noted to be fixed consistent with vocal cord paralysis. Muscle relaxants were then given and we then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Airway inspection was performed and there were thick purulent secretions throughout the airways which were suctioned. In the mid to distal trachea there was approximately 30-40% obstruction from posterior extrinsic compression. The right mainstem was approximately 15% obstructed at the proximal orifice and opened up to be widely patent distally.  The right-sided airways were free of endobronchial disease in the mucosa was normal.  On the left there was significant airway obstruction beginning at the orifice of the left mainstem with friable erythematous mucosa causing approximately 40% obstruction however in the mid left mainstem there is significant protrusion of extrinsic mass with likely some degree of submucosal infiltration resulting in about 90-95% airway obstruction.  The therapeutic bronchoscope could not pass the lesion.  We then attempted to pass lesion with the diagnostic Q 190 bronchoscope and were also unsuccessful. We then again attempted to pass lesion with the ultrasound P190 bronchoscope which was successfully able to bypass lesion.  Approximately 5 mm proximal to the LC2 carina the airways open to near normal luminal diameter.  There were thick postobstructive secretions at all left-sided airways which were suctioned. At this point the flexible bronchoscope was removed along with the LMA and a 10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. There is a significant week which impaired ability to ventilate and multiple attempts at packing the mouth were unsuccessful.  The 10 mm rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13 mm non-ventilating tracheoscope was introduced in the airway in a similar fashion with the hope that this would eliminate/reduce the ventilator leak however similar issues arose and we subsequently decided to remove the rigid bronchoscope and perform the procedure through a 8.5 ET tube which was placed by anesthesia.  There was some hypoxia for a few minutes mostly in the mid 80s but for a short period time in the upper 70s which was likely related to the recruitment from the time period of inadequate ventilation which eventually resolved allowing us to continue with the procedure. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed however slightly too distally and was retracted into proper position with forceps. Balloon dilatation was then performed of the stent which only partially open due to significant external compression using a 10/11/12 CRE balloon which expanded the stent with only mild deformity with a subsequent diameter of the left mainstem approximately 80% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient. 
Recommendations:
-	Transfer back to ward
-	Post-procedure x-ray
-	Start 3% saline nebs 3cc combined with 2cc albuterol 3 times daily for stent maintenance. 
-	Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified 
-	Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and thick mucus and bloody secretions were suctioned from the stent. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The trachea mucosa was friable and inflamed but without residual obstruction. The right mainstem and distal airways were normal. The left mainstem was normal however a small fractures piece of the stent was found within the left mainstem which was removed with flexible forceps without difficulty. The left sided airways were re-inspected and normal without any other residual fractured stent pieces. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed. Post-procedure, the patient developed laryngospasm requiring intubation by anesthesia. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted into the posterior oropharynx and 6cc of topical 1% lidocaine was injected onto the vocal cords prior to extubation after which the patient was able to adequately ventilate prior to transfer to the PACU. 
Complications: Post-procedure laryngospasm requiring re-intubation. 
Recommendations:
- Transfer PACU
- Obtain post procedure CXR
- Discharge to home once criteria met.

Light dosimetry calculation performed pre-procedure

DETAILED PROCEDURE NARRATIVE
The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation, a time-out was performed verifying correct patient, procedure, and photosensitizer administration timing.
Initial Bronchoscopic Survey:
The bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. Systematic examination revealed:

Upper airways: Normal
Trachea: Patent, no lesions
Carina: Sharp, normal
Right bronchial tree: Entirely normal, no endobronchial lesions
Left bronchial tree: Endobronchial tumor visible in left mainstem bronchus

Tumor Characteristics (Pre-PDT measurements):

Location: Left mainstem bronchus, 2cm distal to carina on medial wall
Size: 1.8cm (longitudinal) × 0.9cm (circumferential extent)
Morphology: Flat, slightly raised plaque-like lesion
Color: Pink-red with areas of white keratinization
Surface: Irregular, slightly friable appearance
Obstruction: Approximately 30% luminal narrowing
Distal airways: LUL and LLL fully patent

Photodynamic Therapy Light Delivery:
Laser safety protocols confirmed (room signage, protective eyewear, fire safety measures in place). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was introduced through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The fiber was positioned to center the tumor within the treatment field. Distance measurements confirmed using bronchoscope markings.
Treatment Parameters:

Wavelength: 630 nm (red laser light, optimal for Photofrin activation)
Power output: 400 mW/cm of diffuser length
Diffuser length: 2.5 cm
Total power: 1000 mW (1.0 W)
Light dose (fluence): 200 J/cm² of diffuser surface
Treatment time: 500 seconds (8 minutes 20 seconds)
Calculation: 200 J/cm² ÷ 0.4 W/cm = 500 seconds

Light was continuously delivered for the calculated duration. During light application:

Laser energy meter verified consistent power output
No visible tissue changes during light delivery (expected)
No charring or thermal effects observed (confirming non-thermal mechanism)
Patient hemodynamically stable throughout
No arrhythmias or desaturations

Post-Treatment Assessment:
Immediately following light delivery, the treated area appeared essentially unchanged (expected for PDT). No immediate edema, no bleeding. The fiber was removed and the bronchoscope withdrawn.
Light Precautions Review:
Post-procedure, the following light precautions were reviewed with patient and family:

Strict avoidance of direct sunlight and bright indoor lights for 30 days minimum
Wear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hat, gloves when outdoors
Gradual re-exposure to normal light starting day 30 with skin testing
Emergency contact information provided
Written instructions given

The patient tolerated the procedure well. Extubated in the OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition.
SPECIMENS
None (non-excisional therapy)
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
This 71-year-old female with early-stage endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy-proven 9/15/2024) underwent photodynamic therapy light application session without complications.
Timeline for Follow-up Bronchoscopy:

Scheduled debridement bronchoscopy: October 14, 2024 (48 hours post-light)
Anticipated findings: Necrotic tumor debris requiring mechanical removal
Will assess treatment response and obtain biopsies from treatment bed

Ongoing Management:

Continue light precautions (patient education reinforced)
Monitor for post-PDT complications: airway edema, photosensitivity reactions
Dexamethasone 4mg PO BID x 5 days (reduce airway inflammation)
PPI therapy (reduce risk of esophageal photosensitivity)
Debridement session in 2 days

Long-term surveillance:
Bronchoscopic surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment per protocol.

Patient brought to OR under general anesthesia with 8.5 ETT. Bronchoscope introduced. Right upper lobe examined - all three valves visible and in good position but significant mucous plugging noted distal to valves.
Valve 1 (RB1 apical segment): Grasped with retrieval forceps, removed without difficulty. Some mucous plug came out with valve.
Valve 2 (RB2 posterior segment): This one had granulation tissue at the rim. Used forceps to remove valve, small amount bleeding from granulation tissue controlled with epinephrine and ice saline.
Valve 3 (RB3 anterior segment): Removed easily with forceps.
After valve removal the RUL segments were suctioned extensively. Thick secretions cleared. Mucosa was edematous but no active bleeding. Airways now patent.
Left lung examined - normal. Patient tolerated well, extubated, transferred to recovery.
Specimens: 3 Zephyr valves (not sent to pathology per protocol, retained for documentation), mucous plugs sent for culture.
Follow up: CXR in AM. Likely improved ventilation to RUL now. Patient understands FEV1 may decrease as we've reversed the lung volume reduction effect but pneumonia risk should improve. Will see in clinic 2 weeks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"EMERGENCY BRONCHOSCOPY - HEMOPTYSIS
10/23/24 - 02:35AM
Pt: Marcus Johnson, 57M, MRN 1923847
CALLED FOR: Massive hemoptysis, ICU bed 8
Got called by ICU resident at 2am - patient with known left upper lobe cavitary lesion (likely TB vs fungal) started having massive hemoptysis, estimated 300cc bright red blood over 20 minutes. Oxygen sats dropping to high 80s. Already intubated by ICU team with 8.0 ETT.
RUSHED TO BEDSIDE
Arrived 02:15. Patient sedated on propofol/fent. Sats 91% on FiO2 100%, PEEP 10. Significant blood coming from ETT with suctioning.
SCOPE FINDINGS:
ETT in good position. Massive blood in trachea - suctioned approximately 50cc out just to see.
RIGHT SIDE: Clean, no blood, all segments patent and normal
LEFT SIDE: This is the source. Heavy bleeding coming from LUL. Can't see individual segments yet due to blood volume.
INITIAL MEASURES:

Iced saline lavage: 50cc aliquots x 4 = 200cc total through scope
Some temporary improvement but bleeding continues
Epi 1:10,000: 10cc instilled to LUL - minimal effect
Tranexamic acid: 500mg in 50mL saline instilled via bronch - slight reduction

BALLOON TAMPONADE:
Blood still coming. Advanced 7Fr Fogarty balloon catheter to LUL orifice. Inflated with 6cc saline. IMMEDIATE cessation of blood flow. Good seal.
Kept balloon inflated for 5 minutes. Deflated to check - slight oozing but much slower. Re-inflated for another 5 minutes.
Second deflation - persistent slow oozing from what looks like lingula now that I can see better. Advanced balloon to lingular orifice. Inflated with 4cc. Held 3 minutes. Deflated - bleeding stopped.
FINAL ASSESSMENT @ 03:15AM:
After tamponade cycles, bleeding under control. Can now visualize - appears to be coming from anterior segment LUL and lingula. Mucosa very friable. Likely bleeding from cavitary lesion eroding into vessels.
SPECIMENS: Blood sent for culture (TB, fungal)
PLAN:

ICU team notified - called IR for possible BAE (bronchial artery embolization)
Keep intubated, sedate, minimize suctioning
Reverse any coagulopathy (check labs)
CTA chest to identify bleeding vessel
IR consulted - agree with BAE plan, going to angio suite at 6am
I'll be on standby if rebleeds before IR
If rebleeds: will place endobronchial blocker to LUL for longer-term isolation

UPDATE 03:45AM: Patient stable, no further bleeding currently. IR taking to angio suite. Will follow up later this AM.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
