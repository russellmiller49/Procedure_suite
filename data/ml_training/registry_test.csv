"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Virginia Richardson, a 79-year-old female patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Maria Santos, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.3 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 27 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.0 millimeters in short axis and 23.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.7 millimeters in short axis and 13.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.8 millimeters in short axis and 24.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.0 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 08:45, for a total procedure time of 75 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Gregory Perry, a 54-year-old male patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Maria Santos, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 31.9 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the anteromedial basal (B7+8) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 13.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 57 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.6 millimeters in short axis and 19.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.5 millimeters in short axis and 12.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.8 millimeters in short axis and 25.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.0 millimeters in short axis and 14.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 18.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL anteromedial basal (B7+8). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:14, for a total procedure time of 119 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Joyce Sullivan, a 77-year-old female patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Jennifer Walsh, MD, with Marcus Williams assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 23.2 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.0. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 55 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:45.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 15.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.4 millimeters in short axis and 22.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 4L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.6 millimeters in short axis and 18.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:30, for a total procedure time of 105 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

Date of Procedure: <DATE_TIME>
Institution: Regional Medical Center, <LOCATION>, GA

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 53-year-old male patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed pet-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 20.0 mm solid pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RML medial (B5), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 6.5.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 4. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC190F) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 13.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - small cell carcinoma. Station 4R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 23.9 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma. Station 11R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 19.6 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 17.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 2.5 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RML medial (B5).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated adjacent visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed malignant - nsclc nos.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RML pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - small cell carcinoma
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 11L (13.3mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 7 (10.0mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 2L (24.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system (Auris Health (J&J)) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 3.2mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RUL anterior (B3) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed concentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by radial ebus. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed atypical cells.

The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Timothy Patel, a 64-year-old female patient, presented to Methodist Hospital in New York, NY for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Jason Park assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 14.5 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 50 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.3 millimeters in short axis and 31.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 10.0 millimeters in short axis and 26.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.9 millimeters in short axis and 12.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported atypical cells. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 11:31, for a total procedure time of 136 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Susan Rodriguez, a 46-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in Boston, MA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Jason Park assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 30.4 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 13.0. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 46 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.3 millimeters in short axis and 24.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 23.0 millimeters in short axis and 31.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.0 millimeters in short axis and 25.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:49, for a total procedure time of 79 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 67-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 21.6 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RUL anterior (B3), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. 

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Fujifilm EB-580S) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 10L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 13.0 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 4L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 19.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - small cell carcinoma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.8 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated eccentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via cbct.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (8 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed granuloma.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RUL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - nsclc nos
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

Institution: UCLA Medical Center, Dallas, TX

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 65-year-old male patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 27.1 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the LLL posterior basal (B10), with positive bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 15.4.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 2. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 2L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 20.2 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Station 4R demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 17.2 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma. Station 7 demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 11.6 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes. Station 11R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 17.2 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed granuloma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.9 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the LLL posterior basal (B10).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated eccentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via radial ebus.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed atypical cells.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of LLL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - squamous cell carcinoma
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

"Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note
Procedure: Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with endobronchial valve placement, left upper lobe.
Patient: Logan Pierce, 67-year-old male with severe heterogeneous emphysema and hyperinflation despite maximal medical therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (8.0 mm ETT).
Indication: Symptomatic severe COPD/emphysema with upper-lobe–predominant disease and hyperinflation, candidate for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction.
Pre-procedure imaging and physiology: High-resolution CT with severe LUL-predominant emphysema and intact left oblique fissure (>95% completeness). Quantitative perfusion with relatively preserved perfusion to contralateral lung. Baseline FEV1 32% predicted, RV 210% predicted.
Collateral ventilation assessment: Chartis balloon catheter deployed in the left upper lobe bronchus showed rapid flow decay to zero with plateau, consistent with absence of collateral ventilation.
Procedure details: Under general anesthesia, a therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT. The left bronchial tree was inspected and the LUL bronchus identified. Chartis measurements were obtained as above. A delivery catheter was then advanced, and four Zephyr endobronchial valves were placed sequentially in the apicoposterior, anterior, and lingular segmental bronchi to completely occlude the LUL. Valve positions were confirmed bronchoscopically and with fluoroscopy. After several minutes, there was visible reduction in LUL ventilation with improved excursion of the left hemidiaphragm.
Complications: Minimal self-limited oozing at one segmental orifice controlled with cold saline. No hypoxemia, hemodynamic instability, or immediate pneumothorax.
Disposition: Extubated in the bronchoscopy suite and transferred to step-down unit for post-BLVR monitoring with serial CXRs and telemetry.
Plan: Monitor for post-procedure pneumothorax for at least 72 hours. Continue bronchodilators and pulmonary rehab. Repeat spirometry and 6MWT at 3 months to assess response.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Assistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; cytopathology technologist; radiology technologist.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 16 mm peripheral left lower lobe lateral basal segment nodule with intermediate pre-test probability of malignancy.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the lung based on frozen-section biopsy.
Indication: Same-session diagnosis and local treatment of a peripheral lung cancer in a patient with cardiomyopathy and prohibitive surgical risk.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with radial EBUS confirmation.
2. Transbronchial cryobiopsy of left lower lobe nodule with frozen-section analysis.
3. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: The navigation bronchoscope was advanced to the left lower lobe following registration of the planning CT. Radial EBUS demonstrated a concentric hypoechoic lesion. Two transbronchial cryobiopsies were obtained and submitted for frozen section, which confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma. Perilesional hemorrhage caused mild blurring of the lesion margins on fluoroscopy. A CrossCountry needle was then advanced into the lesion and an extended working channel placed. An Emprint catheter was introduced and a single 10-minute ablation performed. Post-ablation cone-beam CT showed a ground-glass ablation zone encompassing the biopsy cavity with an estimated minimal margin of approximately 5 mm, though interpretation was limited by hemorrhage-related opacities. Bronchoscopy at the end of the case demonstrated oozing in the lateral basal subsegment, which resolved with suctioning and topical iced saline.

Estimated blood loss: 20 mL.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 9 mm pure ground-glass nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe in a patient with advanced emphysema and prior contralateral segmentectomy.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Parenchyma-sparing local ablation of a high-risk ground-glass lesion in a patient not suitable for repeat resection.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT confirmation.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: Following induction and intubation, the bronchoscope was advanced to the left lower lobe. Navigation bronchoscopy guided the catheter to the superior segment airway. A cone-beam CT acquisition confirmed the position of the extended working channel tip relative to the subtle ground-glass lesion. The extended working channel was advanced slightly beyond the lesion center and the Emprint catheter deployed. Given the small lesion size, two shorter ablations (6 minutes and 5 minutes) at standard power were delivered without repositioning. Post-ablation cone-beam CT showed a spherical ablation zone centered on the lesion with an estimated minimal margin of 5 to 6 mm. No significant parenchymal hemorrhage or airway compromise was seen.

Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Lung-preserving local therapy for a new contralateral lesion in a single-lung patient.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 7.5 mm endotracheal tube; lung-protective ventilation; ASA class IV.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT confirmation.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left upper lobe lingular nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: Following careful induction and low tidal-volume ventilation, the bronchoscope was advanced through the single-lumen endotracheal tube to the lingula. Navigation bronchoscopy and fluoroscopic tomosynthesis were used to align the extended working channel with the lesion. A transbronchial needle created a parenchymal tract, and the Emprint catheter was advanced. Because of the patient’s limited reserve, a single 8-minute ablation at standard power was chosen, minimizing procedure time while still targeting an adequate ablation zone. Cone-beam CT confirmed coverage of the 1.5 cm lesion with an estimated minimal margin of approximately 5 mm. No significant desaturation occurred during the case.

Postoperative Diagnosis: Same - confirmed metallic dental crown

Procedures Performed:
1. Rigid bronchoscopy
2. Flexible bronchoscopy
3. Foreign body removal with multiple techniques
4. Balloon dilation of LLL segmental bronchus

Anesthesia: General endotracheal anesthesia (7.5 ETT initially, then exchanged for rigid)

Procedure In Detail:

Initial flexible bronchoscopy performed showing extensive mucopurulent secretions in LLL with visible metallic foreign body impacted in LB10 (posterior basal segment). Mucosal edema and granulation tissue noted around foreign body. Decision made to convert to rigid bronchoscopy given impacted nature.

ETT exchanged for rigid bronchoscope (Efer-Dumon 11mm). Foreign body visualized - gold-colored dental crown, approximately 12mm diameter, wedged tightly in LB10.

Removal Attempts:
1. Rigid optical forceps - grasped crown but slipped due to smooth surface and impaction
2. Dormia basket - unable to deploy past crown due to tight impaction
3. Cryoprobe technique - limited adhesion to metallic surface, unsuccessful
4. Snare device deployed - successfully looped around crown margin
5. Gentle traction with snare + counter-pressure with rigid barrel
6. Crown extracted en bloc after 20 minutes of manipulation

Foreign Body Retrieved:
- Dental crown (porcelain-fused-to-metal)
- Size: 12mm x 10mm
- Intact, no fragments identified

Post-Extraction:
