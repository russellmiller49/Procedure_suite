"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Jerry Morris, a 52-year-old male patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in Atlanta, GA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Marcus Williams assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was pet-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 20.0 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the medial (B5) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.5. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 23 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:45.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 13.8 millimeters in short axis and 21.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 23.9 millimeters in short axis and 31.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 19.6 millimeters in short axis and 30.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 17.4 millimeters in short axis and 22.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML medial (B5). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - nsclc nos. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 12:12, for a total procedure time of 87 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - small cell carcinoma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 3.2 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via radial ebus.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed atypical cells.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RUL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - nsclc nos
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

Biological Sex: Male
Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]
Institution: [REDACTED]

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 49-year-old male patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 30.4 mm solid pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RML lateral (B4), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 13.0.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 2. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 2R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 15.3 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes. Station 11R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 23.0 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Station 4R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 15.0 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 7 demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 13.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 2.6 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated adjacent visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via radial ebus.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (4 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed suspicious for malignancy.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RML pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of adequate lymphocytes
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

"The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the Q190 flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 4 cm proximal to the main carina there was near complete expiratory collapse of the airway which extended into the bilateral mainstem bronchi and bronchus intermedius. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa was boggy throughout, with the exception of the severe dynamic collapse anatomy were otherwise normal with no endobronchial lesions seen to at least the first sub-segments. There was thick purulent secretions within the bilateral lower lobes (likely secondary to chronic post-obstructive pneumonia from severe airway collapse) which were suctioned. Measurements of the collapsible central airways were obtained. We then removed the LMA. A MAC 3 video laryngoscope (C-MAC) was then used to expose the larynx with a grade 1 view obtained. The customized 15x12x12 Dynamic Y-stent with a tracheal length of 80mm, right mainstem limb of 10mm and left mainstem limb which was collapsed and secured with Freitag forceps was then passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The forceps were opened and once resistance was met indicating the stent had reached the main carina the forceps were removed. Subsequently a 12mm rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope was inserted into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid tracheoscope and the stent required minimal adjustment to seat in the desired location. Once this was completed the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. Patient was recovering without issues in the PACU and post-procedure chest x-ray was performed which showed some proximal stent migration and the right sided limb appeared to be of inadequate length to ensure stability. CT was then performed which confirmed the inadequate length f the right sided limb. The patient was then subsequently taken back to the operating room where after induction and administration of paralytics a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilation. Using optical forceps we attempted to remove the original Y-stent however the size of the tracheoscope was inadequate and we converted to a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope which allowed us to easily removed the stent with optical forceps. After-resizing the airways an 18x14x14 Dumon tracheal Y-stent was customized to a tracheal length of 80mm right mainstem length of 30mm and left mainstem limb of 40mm. The stent was then loaded into the Novatech Ton stent deployment device. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of flexible forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed a flexible bronchoscopic inspection to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway collapse. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was completed.",990d1c444355b2ce,golden_113.json,structured,0.95,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE
PART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)
Patient [REDACTED] hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:

Correct patient (ID [REDACTED], verbal confirmation)
Procedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)
Positioning (supine throughout)
Antibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)
Steroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)
Blood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)

Initial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.
Initial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:
Olympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:

Supraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions
Vocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses
Subglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis
Trachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions
Carina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy
Left main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter
LUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent
Right main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.

Decision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.
Rigid Bronchoscopy Phase:
Patient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.
Ventilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.
The rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.
Mechanical Debridement:
Using the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.
Estimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue
Hemostasis Measures:
As expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:

Iced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.
Topical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.
Tranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.

After approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.
Electrocautery:
Flexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.
Treatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus
Treatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time
Effect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis
Argon Plasma Coagulation:
APC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.
Treatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.
Duration: 6 minutes active APC time
Result: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface
Assessment after debridement:
Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.
Balloon Dilation:
Boston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.
Inflation sequence:

First inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Second inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Third inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)

Fluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.
Post-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.
Stent Placement:
After discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.
Stent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length
Deployment technique:

Stent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance
Positioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus
Fluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views
Slow, controlled deployment under direct visualization
Post-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion

Post-stent assessment:
Flexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.
Findings:

Stent well-positioned, no migration
Excellent apposition to airway walls
RUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent
RML orifice: Visible and patent
RLL orifice: Visible and patent
All segments of right lung now visualized for first time
Significant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)

Therapeutic Aspiration:
Extensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:

Right upper lobe: Approximately 30mL
Right middle lobe: Approximately 20mL
Right lower lobe: Approximately 40mL

Total secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.
Final Airway Inspection:

Trachea: Normal
Left bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent
Right main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)
RUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation
Minimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent

Rigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).
Airway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM
Estimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL
Specimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)

PART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)
Patient [REDACTED] arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.
TEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
Surgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):

Subxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm
Dissection carried down to pericardium
Pericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created
Rush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid
Pericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)
No active bleeding from pericardial surface
19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space
Drain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction

TEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.

PART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)
With patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.
Ultrasound examination (performed by IP team):

Right hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion
Estimated volume: 1000-1200mL
Anechoic fluid, no loculations
Compressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)

PleurX catheter placement:
Standard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: [REDACTED]
Initial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).
Chest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures. Occlusive dressing applied.

PROCEDURE CONCLUSION
All procedures completed successfully. Total operative time: 4 hours 15 minutes.
Patient [REDACTED] Conclusion:

Hemodynamically stable (MAP 78, HR 82)
Improved oxygen saturation: 96% on FiO2 0.5 (compared to pre-procedure 88% on FiO2 1.0)
TEE shows improved cardiac function
Bilateral breath sounds now audible

Patient [REDACTED] for transport to ICU given length of procedure and concern for post-obstructive pulmonary edema.
Specimens Sent:

Endobronchial tumor (histology)
Bronchial secretions (bacterial, fungal, AFB cultures)
Pericardial tissue (histology, cytology)
Pericardial fluid (cytology, chemistry)
Pleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)

Estimated Total Blood Loss: 250mL
Fluids Given: 2000mL crystalloid
UOP: 400mL
Complications: None intraoperatively

POSTOPERATIVE DISPOSITION & PLAN
Immediate (ICU):

Extubate when fully awake and following commands (anticipated within 2-4 hours)
Chest X-ray immediately post-procedure and daily x3 days
Monitor pericardial drain output
Pleural catheter to drain q3 days initially
Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (started on Pip-Tazo for post-obstructive pneumonia)
DVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ
PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry

Short-term (Inpatient, 3-5 days):

Remove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day
Transition to floor when stable
Continue PleurX catheter drainage
Pain control
Physical therapy for reconditioning

Medium-term (1-2 weeks):

Discharge with home health for PleurX catheter management
Follow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray
Discuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved

Long-term:

Surveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent
Monitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)
May need stent revision/exchange
PleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life


ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
[REDACTED] critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:

Near-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction → Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent
Cardiac tamponade physiology → Successfully addressed with pericardial window
Large pleural effusion → Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter

All procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:

Restored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)
Resolution of cardiac compromise
Control of pleural effusion

Prognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.
The patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT
I, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement. I assisted the cardiothoracic surgery team during pericardial window creation.
The procedure was medically necessary, technically indicated, and appropriately performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line
INSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT [REDACTED]: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus
The patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.
The bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus [REDACTED] and the [REDACTED] of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.
Lavage Procedure:
The patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37°C) 0.9% normal saline.
Serial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:

Aliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment
Aliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment
Aliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid
Aliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid
Aliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid
Aliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear

Total volume instilled: 6000mL
Total volume returned: 5820mL
Net balance: -180mL (absorbed)
The effluent became progressively clearer. Lavage was discontinued when return fluid was nearly clear. Throughout the procedure, oxygen saturation remained >94% on the ventilated right lung. End-tidal CO2 remained stable at 38-42 mmHg.
After completion of lavage, gentle suctioning was performed through the left bronchial lumen. Bilateral lung ventilation was resumed. DLT [REDACTED] was reconfirmed. The patient was transported to PACU intubated for extubation after full recovery from anesthesia.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Brown, was present throughout the entire procedure.

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring
INSTRUMENT: Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope (3.5mm), optical forceps, foreign body forceps
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT [REDACTED]: Supine with shoulder roll, neck extended
A 3.5mm Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth under direct laryngoscopy. The vocal cords were visualized and appeared normal with symmetric movement. The bronchoscope was advanced through the cords into the trachea.
Initial Survey:

Larynx: Normal
Vocal cords: Normal, symmetric movement
Trachea: Normal caliber, no lesions
Carina: Sharp, normal

The bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. A foreign body was visualized 2cm distal to the carina - a tan-brown, irregular object consistent with a peanut fragment, approximately 8mm in size. The foreign body was partially occluding the right mainstem bronchus with surrounding mucosal edema and mild erythema.
Foreign Body Retrieval:
Optical forceps were advanced through the rigid bronchoscope. The peanut fragment was grasped carefully. Initial attempt at retrieval showed the fragment was somewhat friable. The fragment was gently manipulated and brought into the rigid bronchoscope barrel to prevent fragmentation. The bronchoscope and forceps with the foreign body were withdrawn as a single unit.
The foreign body was removed intact - a peanut fragment measuring approximately 8mm x 5mm.
The bronchoscope was reintroduced for inspection:

Right mainstem: Mild mucosal edema and erythema at the site, no residual foreign material
Right upper lobe: Patent
Right middle lobe: Patent
Right lower lobe: Patent with moderate secretions
Left lung: Examined and found to be normal

Secretions were suctioned from the right lower lobe. No other foreign material was id[REDACTED]. Final inspection showed:

Complete foreign body removal
Mild mucosal trauma with no active bleeding
Patent bilateral airways

The bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.
The attending, Dr. Martinez, was present throughout the entire procedure.

1.         Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation
SURGEON: Aria Winslow, MD
ASSISTANT: Owen Mallory MD
INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.
Recommendations: 
•	Transfer patient back to ward room 
•	Await final pathology results  
•	Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.

INDICATION: Severe COPD with giant bulla RUL, persistent air leak following RUL bullectomy

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial valve placement for persistent air leak management

CONSENT: Extended discussion regarding use of valves for air leak (off-label indication). Risks discussed including valve migration, persistent air leak, infection, bleeding, respiratory failure. Patient and family understood and agreed.

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:
Patient [REDACTED] IP suite with existing chest tube in place demonstrating persistent air leak (large continuous bubbling). Pre-procedure chest CT reviewed showing large residual apical cavity communicating with RUL bronchi.

Moderate sedation achieved. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed:
- Normal larynx and trachea
- RUL: Visualization of communication between RB1 and apical cavity
- Active ""sucking"" noted at RB1 entrance correlating with air leak

INTERVENTION:
Attempted placement of 5.5mm Zephyr valve in RB1. Initial deployment appeared satisfactory.

COMPLICATION:
Immediately following valve placement, patient developed acute desaturation to 82% on 4L NC. Simultaneously noted increase in subcutaneous emphysema and asymmetric chest wall movement. Immediately suspected tension pneumothorax.

MANAGEMENT:
- Procedure aborted
- 100% O2 applied
- Emergency portable CXR confirmed large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift
- Cardiothoracic surgery emergently consulted
- Second chest tube placed (28Fr) with immediate improvement
- Patient stabilized

ADDITIONAL VALVE PLACEMENT:
After stabilization and with CT surgery at bedside, decision made to place additional valve in RB3 to reduce overall flow into cavity.
- 4.0mm valve placed in RB3 without incident
- Air leak notably reduced but not eliminated

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
- Partial success: Air leak reduced from large to moderate
- Complication: Iatrogenic pneumothorax requiring second chest tube
- Both chest tubes to suction with water seal

POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:
- ICU admission  
- Serial CXRs
- Consider additional valve placement if air leak persists after 72 hours
- Family meeting held, understanding confirmed

ASSISTANT: Patricia Hogan MD
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was id[REDACTED] with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina’s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an [REDACTED] CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Await tissue diagnosis
ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.
If patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. 
If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.",0db63ee38298e805,golden_210.json,structured,0.95,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

CASE SUMMARY:
69-year-old woman with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency emphysema (PiZZ genotype), lower lobe predominant disease pattern.

TEACHING POINTS REVIEWED PRE-PROCEDURE:
1. Alpha-1 patients often have basilar predominant disease (unlike smoking-related emphysema)
2. Valve selection sizing based on CT measurements  
3. Chartis interpretation and decision-making
4. Complete vs. incomplete fissure implications

PRE-PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:
☑ Consent obtained and witnessed
☑ Sedation plan reviewed with anesthesia
☑ CT images loaded on workstation
☑ Valves available (multiple sizes)
☑ Chartis system prepared and tested
☑ Fluoroscopy operational
☑ Emergency equipment checked

PROCEDURE WALKTHROUGH:

STEP 1: Airway Assessment
Fellow performed systematic examination with attending supervision. Appropriate technique demonstrated for complete inspection.

STEP 2: Chartis Assessment  
Target: Left Lower Lobe
- Catheter advanced to LLL
- Balloon inflated to create seal at LLL orifice
- Baseline flow and resistance measured
- Results: Flow decay to <30mL/min = NEGATIVE CV
Teaching point: This indicates absent collateral ventilation and favorable for valve therapy

STEP 3: Bronchial Measurement & Valve Selection
CT-based measurements reviewed:
- LB6: 6.8mm diameter → 5.5mm valve selected
- LB8-10: 5.2mm diameter → 4.0mm valve selected

STEP 4: Valve Deployment (Fellow performed with guidance)
- First valve (LB6): Required repositioning due to initial incomplete seal. Good learning opportunity regarding deployment technique.
- Second valve (LB8-10): Successful first attempt with excellent technique
- Final bronchoscopy: Both valves well-positioned, complete occlusion confirmed

TEACHING POINTS POST-PROCEDURE:
1. Valve repositioning is common and not a complication
2. Visual confirmation of complete lobar occlusion is essential
3. Post-procedure care including steroid/antibiotic prophylaxis rationale
4. Expected timeline for symptom improvement (4-6 weeks typically)

FELLOW ASSESSMENT:
Demonstrated good procedural skills. Area for improvement: Pre-deployment assessment of valve orientation. Overall: Progressing well in BLVR competency.

PATIENT [REDACTED]: Tolerated well, stable, admitted for observation per protocol.

- RB1 valve: Excellent position, maintained
- RB2 valve: Migrated distally approximately 1.5cm  
- RB3 valve: Excellent position, maintained
- Result: Incomplete RUL occlusion with air flow to anterior segment

PROCEDURE PLAN: Bronchoscopic valve repositioning/replacement

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Flexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation. Original anatomy reviewed. 

FINDINGS:
- RB1 and RB3 valves well-seated as expected
- RB2 valve visible but clearly malpositioned in subsegmental bronchus
- Surrounding granulation tissue present

INTERVENTION:
Using specialized removal forceps, the migrated RB2 valve was carefully grasped at the retention hooks. Gentle rotational torque applied while maintaining steady traction. Valve successfully removed intact without mucosal injury.

Bronchus re-inspected: Mild granulation tissue at original deployment site. Conservative debridement performed with cytology brush.

NEW VALVE PLACEMENT:
After measuring, new 5.5mm Zephyr valve (one size larger than original 4.0mm) deployed in RB2 with improved wall contact and resistance to migration. Valve delivery system technique modified to ensure more proximal placement.

CONFIRMATION:
Final bronchoscopy confirmed all three valves in excellent position with complete RUL occlusion. No air flow detected.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Successful removal of migrated EBV
2. Successful replacement with larger valve
3. Complete RUL occlusion restored
4. No complications

PLAN:
- Outpatient procedure, observe 4 hours then discharge
- Continue prophylactic antibiotics x 5 days  
- Repeat CT in 6 weeks
- Close follow-up given history of migration

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis, left

ANESTHESIA:
Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine at puncture site

DESCRIPTION:
Patient [REDACTED] upright. Bedside ultrasound demonstrated a small but definite left pleural effusion
with a safe pocket of approximately 2 cm depth at the posterior axillary line.

The skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. Using real-time ultrasound guidance, a
thoracentesis needle and catheter were advanced into the pleural space. Approximately 180 mL of straw-colored
fluid was removed before the patient developed pleuritic chest discomfort and coughing. The procedure was
terminated at that point, but adequate fluid was obtained for diagnostic testing.

No chest tube or tunneled catheter was placed. Post-procedure ultrasound showed residual trace fluid and no
evidence of pneumothorax.

Fluid was sent for cell count, protein, LDH, glucose, cytology, and culture.

Patient ID: [REDACTED]
Date of procedure: [REDACTED]
Attending physician: Dr. N. Patel
Assistants: Pulmonary fellow; radiology technologist; circulating nurse.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 24 mm solid right lower lobe superior segment nodule in a patient with prior stereotactic body radiotherapy to the left lower lobe; PET-avid without nodal disease.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Local treatment of presumed primary lung cancer in a medically inoperable patient.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (Illumisite platform) with cone-beam CT guidance.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: After endotracheal intubation, the navigation bronchoscope was advanced to the right lower lobe. The Illumisite system was used to register the pre-procedural CT and plan a pathway to the superior segment lesion. Initial navigation demonstrated CT-to-body divergence; a tomosynthesis acquisition was performed and the nodule position was updated. A CrossCountry needle was advanced into the lesion, and the extended working channel was positioned 1 cm beyond the nodule center. Two sequential ablations (10 minutes and 7 minutes) were performed with slight retraction of the catheter between ablations to elongate the ablation zone. Cone-beam CT confirmed an elongated ablation zone encompassing the 2.4 cm lesion with an approximate minimal margin of 5 to 6 mm. A small right apical pneumothorax was seen on the post-ablation scan, without hemodynamic compromise.

Estimated blood loss: <10 mL.
Complications: Small asymptomatic right pneumothorax managed conservatively with supplemental oxygen and observation; no chest tube required.
Disposition: Extubated in the operating room, monitored overnight with serial chest radiographs; discharged home on post-procedure day 1 with follow-up CT in 6 to 8 weeks.",1e87fcf1effa28ca,golden_264.json,cpt,0.8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Indication: Suspected lung malignancy
Target: 22mm nodule in LLL

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the RUL Carina (RC1), Bronchus Intermedius, Right Mainstem, Left Carina (LC2), Left Mainstem, Trachea (Distal 1/3), Carina, LUL Lingula Carina (LC1) from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 3.3mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10). Target lesion is approximately 22mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.4cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.

Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 3 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 7 seconds was used. Total 3 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

Transbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.

ROSE Result: Lymphocytes and benign cells, adequate for evaluation

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the RUL Carina (RC1), Left Carina (LC2), Carina, Bronchus Intermedius, RML Carina (RC2), Left Mainstem, Right Mainstem, Trachea (Distal 1/3) from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 1.7mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior-Basal Segment of RLL (RB10). Target lesion is approximately 30mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.

Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 6 seconds was used. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

ROSE Result: Malignant cells id[REDACTED], consistent with squamous cell carcinoma

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.

Indication: PET-avid lung nodule
Target: 15mm nodule in RLL

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient id[REDACTED], procedure, and laterality. An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.

Initial Airway Inspection:
The visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions id[REDACTED]. Mild secretions cleared with suction.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
PCV	11	296	11	80	5	16

The patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.

Electromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 2.2mm.

The device was navigated to the RLL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB8) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Anterior-Basal Segment of RLL.

Radial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Lesion confirmed at target location.

Crucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.

Transbronchial needle aspiration performed with 22G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 6 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

ROSE Result: Atypical cells, cannot exclude malignancy

The inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.

"Indications: Hilar adenopathy
Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy 
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway initially was not well positioned but after replacement with larger LMA seated in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. There were thick greenish mucus plugs throughout the lungs which were easily suctioned. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The scope was advanced into the proximal left upper lobe and a 10mm hypoechoic structure was seen in the area of the 10L lymph node. Within the hypoechoic structure were hyperechoic bands similar to those seen in loculated pleural effusions. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 22G EBUS-TBNA needle and serous appearing liquid was noted within the suction line and attached syringe (approximately 2cc) consistent with cyst.  Subsequent pass with an Olympus 19G EBUS-TBNA needle yielded similar results with another 3cc fluid return. Ultrasound showed shrinkage of the cyst.

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the endotracheal tube was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. Due to hypoxia and difficulty obtaining sufficient chest wall expansion the decision was made to convert to conventional ventilation. The rigid bronchsocpe was attached to the conventional ventilator adapter the mouth was packed and the side ports were closed to allow closed system ventilation. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Within the proximal bronchus intermedius a completely obstructive tumor with overlying blood clot was seen. The right upper lobe however was widely patent. Using cryotherapy probe we removed the overlying blood clot and were able to better visualize the obstructive tumor which originated at the medial aspect of the BI with a wide based stock. A small opening was seen at the lateral aspect but was too small to visualize and open airways distally. Due to high oxygen requirements and persistent hypoxemia we were unable to utilize thermal therapies for debulking.  We thus advanced to the rigid bronchoscope into the proximal bronchus intermedius and using the beveled tip attempted to apple core the proximal edge of the lesion which allowed for us to then cryo-debulk the lesion with a lower risk of developing an area repair.  Two large pieces of tumor were successfully removed with carotid debulking and we were then able to advance the bronchoscope passed the obstruction into the distal bronchus intermedius where we could visualize the right middle lobe and the orifice of the superior segment and basilar segments of the right lower lobe.  Extensive purulent material consistent with postobstructive pneumonia was seen and suctioned into a trap to be sent for culture.  At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed bronchus intermedius with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 20mm x 10mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed without difficulty and the flexible bronchoscope was then re-inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the stent was observed to be well-seated in the bronchus intermedius allowing aeration of the right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, and the distal airways to include the right middle and right lower lobe including the superior segment.  Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was re-intubated fiber-optically without difficulty

Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina an esophageal stent was visualized protruding into the airway causing approximately 30% obstruction of the distal trachea. On closer inspection we could visualize both of the patients telescoping esophageal stent. The proximal end of the inner covered stent could be seen with the origin of the lumen approximately 50% into the airway. The outer uncovered stents proximal origin was seen about 5mm into the distal left mainstem. Additionally a large clip attached to the uncovered outer stent could be seen within the airway. The stents traversed into the left mainstem causing complete occlusion which we could not bypass with the flexible bronchoscope. Bronchial lavage was performed to collect purulent secretions from the airway. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Using flexible forceps we were able to detach and remove the clip. We were aware that the outer uncovered stent was embedded into the trachea and could not be removed. However, given that the inner stents proximal lumen was within the airway and that this stent was not known to be fixed to tissue we chose to attempt the remove the stent enblock through the airway. Using the rigid forceps the proximal edge of the stent was grasped and slowly withdrawn. Initially the stent moved easily however after retracting approximately 3cm of the stent sudden resistance was encountered and the proximal edge of the stent fractured. Given that a much longer segment of the stent was now within the trachea causing significant obstruction (which also now made placement of a tracheal stent impossible) we had no choice except to attempt to further extract the stent. The stent however was firmly fixed and retraction resulted in further fracture with multiple exposed sires within the trachea. Advanced GI endoscopy was called and came to the OR. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an EGD was performed. The proximal edge of the outer uncovered stent  from the esophageal side was embedded and distorted and could not be passed even with the Ultra slim (6mm) gastroscope.  The rigid bronchoscope was reinserted during EGD to better allow us to visualize the communication and attempt to pass a wire in into the esophagus to place an additional stent but the wire would only pass into the airway and this was subsequently aborted leaving us no choice but to continue to remove the esophageal stent piecemeal. Using multiple techniques to include rigid endoscopic scissors, APC, and forceps we slowly removed exposed wires and attempted to transect the stent to allow airway stent placement. This was extremely difficult as more and more unraveling stent was seen. As both stents migrated further into the airway while extracting exposed wires the majority of the stents had to be removed in a piecemeal fashion. Once the stents were removed, with the exception of some small distal wires, the extent of the fistula (which extended during extraction) became completely apparent with the posterior wall of the trachea essentially absent in the lower third with a large defect at the main carina extending directly into the esophagus. We then attempted to place a 15x12x12 hybrid dynamic Y stent into the airway to occlude the fistula by removing the rigid bronchoscope and using glide-scope laryngoscopy visualizing the vocal cords and directly passing the stent, secured with Freitag forceps, into the trachea. Once the stent was within the airway we inserted a  rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope through the vocal cords proximal to the stent. Due to the large defect at the main carina it was extremely difficult to seat the limbs within the bilateral mainstem and despite multiple attempts utilizing rigid forceps, reverse forceps CRE balloons and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we could not adequately seat the stent. The stent was removed and we then attempted to place a smaller 13X10X10 mm dynamic Y with a 5.5cm tracheal limb, a 2cm right sided limb and a 3cm left sided limb using a similar technique and were eventually able to secure the stent in place. Once this was accomplished a 6.5 ETT was inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope and advanced into the proximal limb of the stent and secured in place.   
Complications:  Extension of TE fistula 
Recommendations:
-	Patient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight.
-	Please obtain CXR once patient arrives in ICU
-	Please obtain CT chest prior to extubation if possible 
-	Appreciate GI recommendations. 
-	Please contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient. Anesthesia is also aware
-	Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.
-	If tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.
-	Please do not adjust the endotracheal tubes position or attempt suction unless absolutely necessary (tonight).
-	Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.
-	If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the nose, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. Topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. 
The patient’s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. During the procedure, the patient did develop some intermittent hypoxia, requiring attachment of the oxygen supply to the bronchoscope working channel for direct tracheal oxygen administration which resolved the hypoxia. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the Q190 flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 4 cm proximal to the main carina there was near complete expiratory collapse of the airway which extended into the bilateral mainstem bronchi and bronchus intermedius. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa was boggy throughout, with the exception of the severe dynamic collapse anatomy were otherwise normal with no endobronchial lesions seen to at least the first sub-segments. There was thick purulent secretions within the bilateral lower lobes (likely secondary to chronic post-obstructive pneumonia from severe airway collapse) which were suctioned.  Measurements of the collapsible central airways were obtained. We then removed the LMA. A MAC 3 video laryngoscope (C-MAC) was then used to expose the larynx with a grade 1 view obtained. The customized 15x12x12 Dynamic Y-stent with a tracheal length of 80mm, right mainstem limb of 10mm and left mainstem limb which was collapsed and secured with Freitag forceps was then passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The forceps were opened and once resistance was met indicating the stent had reached the main carina the forceps were removed. Subsequently a 12mm rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope was inserted into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid tracheoscope and the stent required minimal adjustment to seat in the desired location. Once this was completed the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 
Patient [REDACTED] without issues in the PACU and post-procedure chest x-ray was performed which showed some proximal stent migration and the right sided limb appeared to be of inadequate length to ensure stability. CT was then performed which confirmed the inadequate length f the right sided limb. The patient was then subsequently taken back to the operating room where after induction and administration of paralytics a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilation. Using optical forceps we attempted to remove the original Y-stent however the size of the tracheoscope was inadequate and we converted to a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope which allowed us to easily removed the stent with optical forceps. After-resizing the airways an 18x14x14 Dumon tracheal Y-stent was customized to a tracheal length of 80mm right mainstem length of 30mm and left mainstem limb of 40mm. The stent was then loaded into the Novatech Ton stent deployment device.  The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of flexible forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed a flexible bronchoscopic inspection to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway collapse. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was completed.

- Transfer to PACU and then to wards
-  Obtain post procedure CXR
- Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.
- Critical airway posting at bedside.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without and endoluminal obstruction. On the right there was minimal structuring of the BI . On the left the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded. Radial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation however due to the proximal obstruction dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a jagwire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point we performed APC to the left maintem followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly re-opened but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets however once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture. At this point to protect from major vascular bleeding we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax and in the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition.

The airway wall was friable however and oozed easily. We then attempted to gently dilate the anterior-medial segment by bypassing the obstruction and gently inflating the balloon to partial expansion (<6mm) and pull back through the stenosis. When this was done relatively brisk bleeding developed. We then wedged the bronchoscope in the left lower lobe for 2 minutes and reassessed. At that point the bleeding had stopped and we felt that given the distal airway disease (likely radiation induced) and only segmental obstruction, the risk/benefit ratio of continued attempts at dilatation favored abstaining from further intervention. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.",8656f34703d8edc3,golden_313.json,structured,0.95,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Complex Tracheal Stenosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Tracheal stenosis s/p stent placement.

INDICATIONS: Symptomatic tracheal stenosis  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the flexible bronchoscope was inserted into the posterior oropharynx via an LMA. The vocal cords appeared normal. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection a long segment complex tracheal stenosis was visualized beginning approximately 3cm distal to the vocal cords and extending for just under 4cm in length.  The maximal obstruction was approximately 60% of normal airway in the mid to distal aspect of the stenosis. The distal trachea was normal. The right and left sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental airways and with the exception of some thick mucus in the left lower lobe which was easily suctioned there is no endobronchial lesions or irregular mucosa.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient was given paralytics by anesthesia after which a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced just proximal to the tracheal stenosis and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and a 16 x 40 uncovered Ultraflex stent was advanced into the airway alongside a pediatric bronchoscope.  The stent was deployed with direct visualization.  There was slightly distal deployment and the stent was manipulated with both flexible and rigid forceps until it was adequately seated with the proximal and distal limb just beyond the stenosis.  Balloon dilatation was then performed with a 15/16.5/18 urination dilatation of balloon to a maximum diameter of 16.5 mm.  Post dilatation the airway was approximately 90% of normal diameter.  The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and the procedure was completed.

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following induction and paralyitic administration by anesthesia an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. In the orifice of the right mainstem, protruding slightly into the supra-carinal space was a large mass causing complete obstruction. The lesion appeared to have a stock/base and we therefore secured the polypoid lesion using the electrocautery snare. The lesion was snared and immediately hemorrhaged briskly completely obscuring the field of view. The rigid bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem to attempt to isolate the bleeding however the patient’s oxygen saturation continued to fall and the decision was made to remove the rigid scope and insert an ETT. This was done by anesthesia using an 8.0 ETT. The patient was placed right side down to protect the left lung and while suctioning blood via a flexible bronchoscope in the ETT. Vision remained poor and we utilized topical TXA and epi to try to slow the bleeding while using cryotherapy probe to pull blood clots from the airways. Eventually the bleeding stopped and the patient’s oxygen saturation returned to normal. Once we were able to better visualize the airways we found that the left side had relatively mild blood spillover and at the LC1 carina the transected tumor was seen which was removed piecemeal using the cryotherapy probe.  Subsequently we began to debulk further into right lung. The right upper lobe was eventually visualized. We attempted to use APC to ""burn and shave"" residual airway tumor however patient would quickly desat with drops in FIO2 required to safely use thermal therapies. We were able to debulk until what was likely the distal aspect of the BI but significant tumor still remained. Patient had extremely low reserve and since he continued to desaturate limiting our ability to continue debulk we decided to APC the base or the tumor as well as the residual tumor in the airway wall until we were confident that there was no active bleeding and abort attempts to further debulk for now and to consider returning to the OR at a later date. Once this was accomplished the ETT position was confirmed to be 3cm above the carina. The bronchoscope was removed and there procedure completed. Decision in consultation with anesthesia was for patient to remain intubated for now and transfer to the ICU.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was normal. On the right there was a small focus of tumor just prximal to the right upper lobe at the anterior wall which was non-obstructive. The right sided airways were otherwise normal. The left mainstem was normal.  At the takeoff of the left lower lobe there was a vascular appearing endobronchial mass causing complete airway obstruction. At the takeoff of the left upper lobe there was a similar appearing vascular endobronchial lesion causing complete airway obstruction. With gentile manipulation of the tumor it was noted to bleed easily. APC was used to devascularize the superficial layer of the left upper and lower lobe tumors.  The electrocautery snare was then used to remove the prximal portion of the left upper lobe tumor after which we cold visualize distal airways. The tumor extended to just proximal to the lingual take-off and distally there did not appear to be evidence of active tumor.  Using APC we used the burn and shave method to slowly debulk the tumor as well as flexible forceps debulking of charred tumor after APC cauterization. Bleeding was moderate and resolved with topical instillation of 1:1000 TXA through the bronchoscope. After debulking in the left upper lobe we had complete opening of the lobar and segmental bronchi. We then brought our attention to the left lower lobe lesion. Using the electrocautery snare in a similar fashion we were able to debulk the proximal tumor. There was much more extensive distal tumor in the lower lobe with tumor involving multiple segmental bronchi. Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract some of the tissue after which we utilized APC and flexible forceps in a similar fashion as performed in the left upper lobe to slowly debulk the tumor. We were able to open the left lower lobe orifice to approximately 70% of normal but despite our best efforts we could not completely remove the tumor due to the extent of disease and distal tumor infiltration. APC was used at the end of the procedure to paint cauterize any active oozing and once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.

The vocal cords appeared normal. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Within the distal right mainstem completely obstructive tumor and mucous was seen. The mucous was suctioned and tumor obstructive tumor was visualized in the proximal BI just below the right upper lobe. There was yellow plaques through the right mainstem extending into the right upper lobe with an appearance consistent with radiation bronchitis. Within the right upper lobe there was a combination of tumor and radiation bronchitis resulting in occlusion of the apical and anterior segments and about 80% obstruction of the posterior segment. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the patient [REDACTED] paralytics by anesthesia after which a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the ventilator.

At this point we id[REDACTED] a small orifice in the tumor within the bronchus intermedius which had a stricture like appearance. The electrocautery knife was used to make radial incisions after which large volume of pus was expressed for the distal airways. A trap was placed and the purulent material was suctioned and collected for culture. We were unable to pass the thin bronchoscope through the orifice or insert a CRE balloon due to the size.    We then began to slowly debulk the endobronchial tumor through the use of a combination of APC, and forceps. We continued to debulk the tumor and utilizing an 6-7-8 CRE balloon were able to achieve approximately 70% recanalization of the proximal and mid broncus intermedius and the proximal right lower lobe orifice. A small opening was id[REDACTED] leading to the distal BI where we could see the orifice of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe however there was extensive tumor infiltration which continued into the lobar bronchi. The right middle lobe orifice was also encased with extensive tumor and we could only achieve about 10% recanalization. Infiltrating friable areas of tumor were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Due to the extent of tumor within the distal airways we did not believe that airway stent placement would be appropriate as distal tumor ingrowth would likely occur. We then addressed the right upper lobe where we were able to gently debulk tumor with APC and flexible forceps to where the apical and anterior segments (which were anatomically fused could be id[REDACTED].

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  The proximal and mid left mainstem were normal. In the distal left mainstem a white fungating tumor was seen causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and extending from the left lower lobe bronchus to causing complete obstruction of the lingula and 80% obstruction of the left mainstem.  The LMA was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then utilized cryoextraction to remove large pieces of tumor piece meal. Most of the superficial tumor was avascular and did not bleed but as we continued debulking into less necrotic tumor mild bleeding occurred and was treated with cold saline flushes. After extensive debulking we were able to advance the bronchoscope into the lingula were some purulent secretions were seen and performed mini BAL. The tumor however extended into the subsegments of the lingula and deemed likely not salvageable with endobronchial treatment alone.  APC was then used to coagulate the residual superficial layer of oozing tumor. At the end of the procedure distal left mainstem was only 15% obstructed. The left upper lobe proper (anterior and apical posterior segments) were completely patent. The lingula was 80% obstructed and the left lower lobe remained completely obstructed with distal tumor.

Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords the patients previous stent could be visualized. Throughout the stent were thick purulent material consistent with infection. The telescoped distal tracheal stent was noted to have migrated into the right mainstem causing complete occlusion of the left mainstem. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid and into the stent. Bronchial lavage was performed with specimen obtained by trap and sent for culture. The proximal edge of the distal telescoped stent was visualized and using flexible forceps we secured the proximal knot and attempted to withdraw the stent. The stent moved only slightly but enough to visualize copious amounts of post-obstructive pus being expressed from the previously obstructed left mainstem. The material was collected in a trap for culture. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps. The proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent. Both stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope. The airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass. The patient’s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula. The airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Sedation:
General anesthesia with an 8.5 mm endotracheal tube (ETT).
Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. The patient was positioned supine and underwent general anesthesia with an 8.5 mm ETT. Using the Olympus Q190 standard video-bronchoscope, the trachea was inspected and appeared clear. The left bronchial tree was visualized and found to be normal.
The right mainstem bronchus was clear, while the right upper lobe exhibited submucosal tumor growth with patent airways. The proximal bronchus intermedius (BI) displayed normal luminal structure with approximately 15% obstruction from extraluminal tumor. The distal BI was normal. The right middle lobe (RML) had 80% obstruction due to submucosal infiltration. The right lower lobe (RLL) was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor.
The bronchoscope was exchanged for an EBUS scope. A 2.5 cm lymph node in station 11R1 was id[REDACTED] and biopsied using a 22G ViziShot-2 needle. Five passes were performed, and rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignancy.
The procedure was then switched to a therapeutic bronchoscope (3.2 mm working channel). Forceps biopsies were taken from the proximal RLL, followed by tumor cryoextraction and ablation with argon plasma coagulation (APC). A Fogarty balloon catheter was used to remove distal tumor and debris. Airway dilation of the RLL was performed with an [REDACTED] mm Elation balloon dilator.
The RLL superior segment remained near-completely obstructed, but visualization revealed mostly uninvolved basilar segments with minimal tumor involvement. A 10 x 15 mm Aero stent was placed in the RLL, with the proximal edge positioned just distal to the RML and jailing the superior segment. The basilar segments were patent beyond the stent. The stent was further dilated using a [REDACTED] mm Elation balloon. Post-procedure, the RLL was approximately 85% patent.
The procedure concluded without complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).

Site 1: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.
 
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node waswas < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.
 
All other lymph node stations did not have any detectable lymph nodes noted. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and Transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
