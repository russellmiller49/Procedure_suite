"Brian Cruz, MRN 2961138, a 80-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Memorial Hospital on 05/08/2024. The indication was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis with a 16.3mm part-solid lesion in the RUL anterior (B3), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 12.4. The patient was ASA class 4 with smoking history of 27 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope with 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 2L (19.0mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma); station 10L (22.7mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma); station 7 (16.8mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy).

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 02/23/2025, Virginia Richardson, a 79-year-old female patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Maria Santos, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.3 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 27 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.0 millimeters in short axis and 23.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.7 millimeters in short axis and 13.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.8 millimeters in short axis and 24.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.0 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 08:45, for a total procedure time of 75 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"Jason James, MRN 7329799, a 64-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Regional Medical Center on 11/11/2024. The indication was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup with a 25.0mm solid lesion in the LUL anterior (B3), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 9.6. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 40 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope with 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 7 (19.5mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Granuloma); station 11L (18.1mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma); station 10R (17.1mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Granuloma); station 4L (11.5mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Atypical cells). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system (Auris Health (J&J)) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.6mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the LUL anterior (B3) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed eccentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (4 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.

The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 09/18/2025, Emma Jones, a 64-year-old male patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Andrew Nakamura, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 25.0 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 9.6. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.5 millimeters in short axis and 24.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.1 millimeters in short axis and 17.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 17.1 millimeters in short axis and 27.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.5 millimeters in short axis and 24.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:33, for a total procedure time of 123 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 07/01/2025, Julie Mitchell, a 82-year-old male patient, presented to Academic Health System in Miami, FL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Rachel Goldman, MD.

The clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 14.0 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the apicoposterior (B1+2) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 17.6. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 34 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 14.8 millimeters in short axis and 28.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 24.3 millimeters in short axis and 25.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 12.9 millimeters in short axis and 30.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.8 millimeters in short axis and 34.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.7 millimeters in short axis and 20.8 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:09, for a total procedure time of 114 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"Christine Garcia, MRN 6402233, a 62-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Presbyterian Hospital on 03/04/2024. The indication was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis with a 16.9mm solid lesion in the RML lateral (B4), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 16.9. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 58 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope with 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10R (9.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy); station 4L (13.8mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma); station 4R (21.4mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes).

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 12/15/2024, Heather Flores, a 57-year-old female patient, presented to Presbyterian Hospital in Phoenix, AZ for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.9 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 58 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:00.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 9.9 millimeters in short axis and 21.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.8 millimeters in short axis and 21.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 31.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 8 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:40, for a total procedure time of 100 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 09/25/2024, Larry Anderson, a 82-year-old female patient, presented to Community Hospital in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 23.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the posterior basal (B10) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 2.8. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 25 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:00.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.9 millimeters in short axis and 22.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 27.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.1 millimeters in short axis and 28.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.4 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:05, for a total procedure time of 125 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 11:31, for a total procedure time of 136 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"Nancy Nguyen, MRN 5694950, a 42-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Memorial Hospital on 02/09/2024. The indication was peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes with a 24.3mm solid lesion in the LUL superior lingula (B4), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 12.7. The patient was ASA class 4 with smoking history of 49 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope with 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 4L (21.5mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 10L (21.1mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 11L (8.8mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma).

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 09/11/2025, Samantha Williams, a 41-year-old male patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Robert Patel, MD, with Priya Sharma assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 24.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the superior lingula (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 49 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.5 millimeters in short axis and 32.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.1 millimeters in short axis and 12.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.8 millimeters in short axis and 15.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL superior lingula (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:18, for a total procedure time of 108 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"Nancy Reyes, MRN 9308712, a 64-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Baptist Medical Center on 03/15/2025. The indication was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis with a 27.5mm ground-glass lesion in the RLL superior (B6), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 16.3. The patient was ASA class 4 with smoking history of 34 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope with 22-gauge Acquire needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 11R (22.0mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma); station 4R (13.7mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Atypical cells); station 11L (18.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma).

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 06/27/2025, Noah Mitchell, a 72-year-old female patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in Denver, CO for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Steven Park, MD, with Jason Park assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 27.5 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the superior (B6) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.3. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 34 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.0 millimeters in short axis and 13.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 29.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.9 millimeters in short axis and 31.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL superior (B6). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:10, for a total procedure time of 100 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 03/30/2025, Joshua Bennett, a 50-year-old female patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in Miami, FL for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Eric Johnson, MD, with Priya Sharma assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 19.4 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 54 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.2 millimeters in short axis and 29.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 8.8 millimeters in short axis and 22.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.8 millimeters in short axis and 31.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported granuloma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 11:41, for a total procedure time of 131 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 18.5 millimeters in short axis and 22.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 11:02, for a total procedure time of 92 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 10/10/2025, Susan Rodriguez, a 46-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center in Boston, MA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Jason Park assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 30.4 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 13.0. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 46 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.3 millimeters in short axis and 24.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 23.0 millimeters in short axis and 31.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.0 millimeters in short axis and 25.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:49, for a total procedure time of 79 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"Rachel Davis, MRN 7951980, a 53-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Regional Medical Center on 03/13/2025. The indication was pet-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a 23.3mm solid lesion in the RLL medial basal (B7), bronchus sign negative. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of None pack-years (never). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope with 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 2R (12.0mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 10R (12.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 2L (13.9mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Granuloma).

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 12/14/2024, Jennifer Miller, a 54-year-old female patient, presented to Regional Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was pet-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 23.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the medial basal (B7) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 12.0 millimeters in short axis and 33.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 12.9 millimeters in short axis and 26.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 13.9 millimeters in short axis and 22.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.9 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL medial basal (B7). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 12:49, for a total procedure time of 139 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"Adam Morgan, MRN 6609863, a 64-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at UCLA Medical Center on 07/21/2024. The indication was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes with a 27.1mm ground-glass lesion in the LLL posterior basal (B10), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 15.4. The patient was ASA class 2 with smoking history of 40 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope with 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 2L (20.2mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma); station 4R (17.2mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma); station 7 (11.6mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 11R (17.2mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Granuloma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.9mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the LLL posterior basal (B10) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed eccentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by radial ebus. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed atypical cells.

The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On 08/24/2024, Ronald Henderson, a 67-year-old male patient, presented to UCLA Medical Center in Dallas, TX for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 27.1 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the posterior basal (B10) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 15.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 20.2 millimeters in short axis and 30.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 17.2 millimeters in short axis and 31.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.6 millimeters in short axis and 19.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 17.2 millimeters in short axis and 15.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.9 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL posterior basal (B10). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using radial ebus.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported atypical cells. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 11:55, for a total procedure time of 85 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Higgins, a 66-year-old gentleman with severe heterogeneous emphysema characterized by marked left upper lobe hyperinflation, presented for elective bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. Preoperative evaluation revealed an intact left oblique fissure and quantitative perfusion demonstrating preservation of the contralateral lung.
OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: Following the induction of general anesthesia and placement of an 8.0 mm endotracheal tube, the airway was examined. The left bronchial tree was systematically interrogated. A Chartis balloon catheter assessment of the LUL bronchus yielded a CV-negative phenotype (rapid flow decay to zero). Consequently, four Zephyr endobronchial valves were sequentially deployed into the apicoposterior, anterior, and lingular segments. Post-deployment inspection confirmed complete lobar occlusion. Immediate physiological response was noted via improved excursion of the left hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: Successful LUL BLVR. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the step-down unit for close pneumothorax surveillance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with endobronchial valve placement, left upper lobe was performed on Edward Stone, a 68-year-old male with severe heterogeneous emphysema. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (8.0 mm ETT) was utilized. High-resolution CT showed severe LUL-predominant emphysema and intact left oblique fissure. Chartis balloon catheter deployed in the left upper lobe bronchus showed rapid flow decay to zero with plateau, consistent with absence of collateral ventilation. Under general anesthesia, a therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was advanced. Four Zephyr endobronchial valves were placed sequentially in the apicoposterior, anterior, and lingular segmental bronchi to completely occlude the LUL. Valve positions were confirmed bronchoscopically and with fluoroscopy. Minimal self-limited oozing occurred. The patient was extubated and transferred to the step-down unit for post-BLVR monitoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NOTE

Date: 2025-09-28
Patient: Robert Martinez
MRN: 2844661
DOB: 04/15/1971 (53 years old)

Attending: Dr. Jennifer Liu, MD
Location: VA Medical Center, San Diego, CA

INDICATION: 53-year-old male with 30 pack-year smoking history presenting with 3-day history of moderate hemoptysis (approximately 100mL/day). CT chest showed bilateral upper lobe bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud opacities. Sputum cultures pending. Bronchoscopy for airway inspection and clearance of blood/secretions.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemoptysis, likely infectious etiology vs bronchiectasis

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions; no endobronchial lesion or active bleeding source identified

PROCEDURE: Diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic suctioning

SEDATION: Moderate sedation (Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 50mcg IV)

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient was sedated and the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-P190) was introduced via the oropharynx. The vocal cords appeared normal without lesions or edema. The trachea was patent with normal mucosa. Carina was sharp.

AIRWAY FINDINGS:
- Right mainstem: Patent. Old blood coating the mucosa.
- Right upper lobe: Multiple segments with thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood. Significant bronchiectatic changes. No endobronchial lesions. No active bleeding visualized.
- Bronchus intermedius: Patent with mild inflammation
- Right middle lobe: Mucopurulent secretions, no masses
- Right lower lobe: Bronchiectatic changes, thick secretions
- Left mainstem: Patent, old blood noted
- Left upper lobe: Similar bronchiectatic changes with mucopurulent secretions. No tumor or active bleeding.
- Lingula: Mild secretions
- Left lower lobe: Bronchiectasis, mucopurulent secretions, no source of bleeding identified

THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:
Extensive suctioning performed throughout all visualized airways. Large quantities of thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood were cleared from bilateral bronchi. No single bleeding source could be identified - the hemoptysis appears to be diffuse from inflamed bronchiectatic airways.

No biopsy was performed as no discrete lesion identified. No BAL performed as secretions already sent from suctioning.

SPECIMENS: 
- Bronchial aspirate/secretions: Bacterial culture, fungal culture, AFB culture, cytology

COMPLICATIONS: None. No active bleeding during or after procedure.

EBL: Trace

POST-PROCEDURE: Patient tolerated well. No respiratory distress. CXR unchanged from pre-procedure.

IMPRESSION & PLAN:
1. Diffuse bilateral bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions - no discrete bleeding source identified
2. Hemoptysis likely from diffuse bronchiectatic mucosal inflammation with superimposed infection
3. No endobronchial malignancy identified
4. Continue empiric antibiotics pending cultures
5. Pulmonary hygiene with chest physiotherapy
6. Follow-up in 2 weeks; consider repeat CT if hemoptysis persists

"OPERATIVE REPORT - INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY / THORACIC SURGERY

DATE: 2025-08-15
PATIENT: Linda Thompson
MRN: 1472710
DOB: 09/28/1960 (64 years old)

SURGEONS:
IP: Dr. Mark Anderson, MD (started case)
Thoracic Surgery: Dr. Sarah Kim, MD (completed case after conversion)

LOCATION: Main OR, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right-sided exudative pleural effusion, unknown etiology

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dense pleural adhesions with loculated effusion; trapped lung

PLANNED PROCEDURE: Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with pleural biopsy and potential talc poudrage

ACTUAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Attempted medical thoracoscopy (aborted)
2. Conversion to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery)
3. VATS lysis of adhesions
4. VATS pleural biopsy
5. Decortication (partial)
6. Chest tube placement

INDICATION: 64-year-old female with 2-month history of progressive dyspnea. CT chest revealed large right pleural effusion with mild enhancement of pleura concerning for malignancy. Thoracentesis x 2 showed exudative effusion with negative cytology. Medical thoracoscopy planned for definitive diagnosis and potential pleurodesis.

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube (left-sided)

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:

MEDICAL THORACOSCOPY ATTEMPT (Dr. Anderson):
Patient positioned in left lateral decubitus. After induction of general anesthesia and lung isolation, the right chest was prepped and draped. Ultrasound examination revealed a small pocket of fluid in the mid-axillary line but significant lung adherence to chest wall throughout.

A 2cm incision was made in the 6th intercostal space. Upon blunt dissection into the pleural space, immediate dense adhesions were encountered. The 7mm trocar could not be safely advanced due to extensive lung-to-chest-wall adhesions. A small pocket of loculated fluid (~200mL) was drained but no window could be created for safe pleuroscopy. Multiple attempts at different intercostal spaces (5th, 7th) encountered similar dense adhesions.

DECISION TO CONVERT: After thorough discussion with thoracic surgery colleagues and the patient's family (who had been counseled preoperatively about this possibility), the decision was made to convert to VATS for safe completion of the procedure.

VATS PROCEDURE (Dr. Kim):
The incision was extended and a 10mm port placed under direct vision where a small pleural space was identified. Two additional 5mm ports were placed. Dense adhesions were found throughout the hemithorax. Using a combination of blunt dissection, electrocautery, and harmonic scalpel, extensive adhesiolysis was performed over approximately 90 minutes.

Findings:
- Dense fibrinous adhesions throughout
- Thickened visceral pleura with trapped lung
- Nodular thickening of parietal pleura (multiple biopsies taken)
- Approximately 500mL of loculated, amber-colored fluid drained

Multiple parietal pleural biopsies were obtained from chest wall and diaphragmatic pleura. Partial decortication of the visceral pleura was performed to allow lung expansion, though complete expansion could not be achieved due to chronic entrapment.

A 28Fr chest tube was placed. Negative-pressure water seal established. Lung expansion approximately 70% at end of case.

SPECIMENS:
- Pleural fluid: Cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures, adenosine deaminase
- Pleural biopsies (multiple): Surgical pathology

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150mL

COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively. Conversion was planned contingency.

DISPOSITION: Transferred to SICU for overnight monitoring. Chest tube to suction.

POST-OPERATIVE PLAN:
1. Monitor chest tube output
2. CXR in AM
3. Await pathology - concern for malignant mesothelioma or chronic fibrinous pleuritis
4. If lung remains trapped, may require chronic indwelling pleural catheter
