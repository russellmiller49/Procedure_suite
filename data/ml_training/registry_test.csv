Biological Sex: Male
Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]
Institution: [REDACTED]

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 79-year-old male patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 14.0 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 17.6.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 2. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Pentax EB-1990i) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 14.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 4L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 24.3 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Station 10R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 12.9 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 10L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 18.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed suspicious for malignancy. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 18.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.5 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via fluoroscopy.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 5 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of LUL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of atypical cells
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Noah Mitchell, a 72-year-old female patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Steven Park, MD, with Jason Park assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 27.5 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the superior (B6) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.3. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 34 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 22.0 millimeters in short axis and 13.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 13.7 millimeters in short axis and 29.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 18.9 millimeters in short axis and 31.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL superior (B6). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:10, for a total procedure time of 100 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Margaret Ortiz, a 64-year-old female patient, presented to Presbyterian Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Robert Patel, MD, with Jason Park assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 21.6 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 41 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 13.0 millimeters in short axis and 14.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 15.7 millimeters in short axis and 23.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 19.4 millimeters in short axis and 27.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 8 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported granuloma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:40, for a total procedure time of 85 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Ashley Sanders, a 68-year-old male patient, presented to Northwestern Memorial Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 29.4 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 43 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 15.5 millimeters in short axis and 31.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.7 millimeters in short axis and 14.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 20.5 millimeters in short axis and 29.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 11:36, for a total procedure time of 81 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

PATIENT: [REDACTED]
PROCEDURE: Left-sided medical thoracoscopy with parietal pleural biopsy and talc pleurodesis.

CLINICAL SUMMARY: The patient is a 68-year-old male with metastatic adenocarcinoma presenting with rapid re-accumulation of pleural fluid.

DETAILED NARRATIVE: Following the induction of general anesthesia and isolation of the left lung via a double-lumen tube, the left hemithorax was accessed at the 6th intercostal space under sonographic guidance. Upon trocar entry, approximately 1800 mL of serosanguinous effusion was evacuated. Thoracoscopic visualization revealed extensive nodularity of the parietal pleura. Representative biopsies were harvested. Subsequently, a slurry comprising 4 grams of talc in 50 mL saline was instilled and uniformly distributed.

The forceps were opened and once resistance was met indicating the stent had reached the main carina the forceps were removed. Subsequently a 12mm rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope was inserted into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid tracheoscope and the stent required minimal adjustment to seat in the desired location. Once this was completed the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. Patient was recovering without issues in the PACU and post-procedure chest x-ray was performed which showed some proximal stent migration and the right sided limb appeared to be of inadequate length to ensure stability. CT was then performed which confirmed the inadequate length f the right sided limb. The patient was then subsequently taken back to the operating room where after induction and administration of paralytics a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilation. Using optical forceps we attempted to remove the original Y-stent however the size of the tracheoscope was inadequate and we converted to a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope which allowed us to easily removed the stent with optical forceps. After-resizing the airways an 18x14x14 Dumon tracheal Y-stent was customized to a tracheal length of 80mm right mainstem length of 30mm and left mainstem limb of 40mm. The stent was then loaded into the Novatech Ton stent deployment device. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of flexible forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed a flexible bronchoscopic inspection to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway collapse. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was completed.",990d1c444355b2ce,golden_113.json,structured,0.95,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.

Hemithorax: Right
Pleural Effusion Volume: Large
Echogenicity: Anechoic
Loculations: None
Diaphragmatic Motion: Diminished
Lung sliding before procedure: Present
Lung consolidation/atelectasis: Present (compressive atelectasis)
Pleura: Mildly thickened, no nodularity visualized

The right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to id[REDACTED] the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.
ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract
Entry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space
Location: [REDACTED]
Procedure Steps:

A finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038"" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.
Two 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.
The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.
Serial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.
The guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).
The introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).
The catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.
Sterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).

Exit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line
Initial Drainage:
The PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.

Fluid Removed: 1200 mL
Appearance: Serous, straw-colored

Pleural Pressures Measured:

Opening: -8 cmH₂O
500ml: -10 cmH₂O
1000ml: -15 cmH₂O

"OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE
PART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)
Patient [REDACTED] hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:

Correct patient (ID [REDACTED], verbal confirmation)
Procedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)
Positioning (supine throughout)
Antibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)
Steroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)
Blood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)

Initial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.
Initial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:
Olympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:

Supraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions
Vocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses
Subglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis
Trachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions
Carina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy
Left main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter
LUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent
Right main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.

Decision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.
Rigid Bronchoscopy Phase:
Patient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.
Ventilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.
The rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.
Mechanical Debridement:
Using the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.
Estimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue
Hemostasis Measures:
As expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:

Iced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.
Topical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.
Tranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.

After approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.
Electrocautery:
Flexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.
Treatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus
Treatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time
Effect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis
Argon Plasma Coagulation:
APC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.
Treatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.
Duration: 6 minutes active APC time
Result: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface
Assessment after debridement:
Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.
Balloon Dilation:
Boston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.
Inflation sequence:

First inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Second inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Third inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)

Fluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.
Post-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.
Stent Placement:
After discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.
Stent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length
Deployment technique:

Stent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance
Positioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus
Fluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views
Slow, controlled deployment under direct visualization
Post-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion

Post-stent assessment:
Flexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.
Findings:

Stent well-positioned, no migration
Excellent apposition to airway walls
RUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent
RML orifice: Visible and patent
RLL orifice: Visible and patent
All segments of right lung now visualized for first time
Significant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)

Therapeutic Aspiration:
Extensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:

Right upper lobe: Approximately 30mL
Right middle lobe: Approximately 20mL
Right lower lobe: Approximately 40mL

Total secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.
Final Airway Inspection:

Trachea: Normal
Left bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent
Right main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)
RUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation
Minimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent

Rigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).
Airway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM
Estimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL
Specimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)

PART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)
Patient [REDACTED] arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.
TEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
Surgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):

Subxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm
Dissection carried down to pericardium
Pericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created
Rush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid
Pericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)
No active bleeding from pericardial surface
19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space
Drain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction

TEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.

PART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)
With patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.
Ultrasound examination (performed by IP team):

Right hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion
Estimated volume: 1000-1200mL
Anechoic fluid, no loculations
Compressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)

PleurX catheter placement:
Standard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: [REDACTED]
Initial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).
Chest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures. Occlusive dressing applied.

PROCEDURE CONCLUSION
All procedures completed successfully. Total operative time: 4 hours 15 minutes.
Patient [REDACTED] Conclusion:

Hemodynamically stable (MAP 78, HR 82)
Improved oxygen saturation: 96% on FiO2 0.5 (compared to pre-procedure 88% on FiO2 1.0)

Estimated Total Blood Loss: 250mL
Fluids Given: 2000mL crystalloid
UOP: 400mL
Complications: None intraoperatively

POSTOPERATIVE DISPOSITION & PLAN
Immediate (ICU):

Extubate when fully awake and following commands (anticipated within 2-4 hours)
Chest X-ray immediately post-procedure and daily x3 days
Monitor pericardial drain output
Pleural catheter to drain q3 days initially
Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (started on Pip-Tazo for post-obstructive pneumonia)
DVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ
PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry

Short-term (Inpatient, 3-5 days):

Remove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day
Transition to floor when stable
Continue PleurX catheter drainage
Pain control
Physical therapy for reconditioning

Medium-term (1-2 weeks):

Discharge with home health for PleurX catheter management
Follow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray
Discuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved

Long-term:

Surveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent
Monitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)
May need stent revision/exchange
PleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life


ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
[REDACTED] critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:

Near-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction → Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent
Cardiac tamponade physiology → Successfully addressed with pericardial window
Large pleural effusion → Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter

All procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:

Restored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)
Resolution of cardiac compromise
Control of pleural effusion

Prognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.
The patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT

Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]

Proceduralist(s): Thomas Wright, MD, Pulmonologist; Nicole Stevens, MD (Fellow)

Procedure(s) Performed:
• CPT 31629 Flexible bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic transbronchial needle aspiration
• CPT 31627 Bronchoscopy with computer assisted image guided navigation
• CPT 31654 Bronchoscopy with Endobronchial Ultrasound guidance for peripheral lesion
• CPT 31624 Bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage

Indications: Migratory lung nodules
Medications: General Anesthesia

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.

Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there were no endobronchial lesions. There were thick non-purulent secretions in multiple airways which were suctioned.

Following inspection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180 cc instillation and 70 cc return. The SuperDimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software, we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest. Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen. Subsequently, further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation. After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.

Complications: No immediate complications

INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction secondary to esophageal stent migration
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina an esophageal stent was visualized protruding into the airway causing approximately 30% obstruction of the distal trachea. On closer inspection we could visualize both of the patients telescoping esophageal stent. The proximal end of the inner covered stent could be seen with the origin of the lumen approximately 50% into the airway. The outer uncovered stents proximal origin was seen about 5mm into the distal left mainstem. Additionally a large clip attached to the uncovered outer stent could be seen within the airway. The stents traversed into the left mainstem causing complete occlusion which we could not bypass with the flexible bronchoscope. Bronchial lavage was performed to collect purulent secretions from the airway. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Using flexible forceps we were able to detach and remove the clip. We were aware that the outer uncovered stent was embedded into the trachea and could not be removed. However, given that the inner stents proximal lumen was within the airway and that this stent was not known to be fixed to tissue we chose to attempt the remove the stent enblock through the airway. Using the rigid forceps the proximal edge of the stent was grasped and slowly withdrawn. Initially the stent moved easily however after retracting approximately 3cm of the stent sudden resistance was encountered and the proximal edge of the stent fractured. Given that a much longer segment of the stent was now within the trachea causing significant obstruction (which also now made placement of a tracheal stent impossible) we had no choice except to attempt to further extract the stent. The stent however was firmly fixed and retraction resulted in further fracture with multiple exposed sires within the trachea. Advanced GI endoscopy was called and came to the OR. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an EGD was performed. The proximal edge of the outer uncovered stent  from the esophageal side was embedded and distorted and could not be passed even with the Ultra slim (6mm) gastroscope.  The rigid bronchoscope was reinserted during EGD to better allow us to visualize the communication and attempt to pass a wire in into the esophagus to place an additional stent but the wire would only pass into the airway and this was subsequently aborted leaving us no choice but to continue to remove the esophageal stent piecemeal. Using multiple techniques to include rigid endoscopic scissors, APC, and forceps we slowly removed exposed wires and attempted to transect the stent to allow airway stent placement. This was extremely difficult as more and more unraveling stent was seen. As both stents migrated further into the airway while extracting exposed wires the majority of the stents had to be removed in a piecemeal fashion. Once the stents were removed, with the exception of some small distal wires, the extent of the fistula (which extended during extraction) became completely apparent with the posterior wall of the trachea essentially absent in the lower third with a large defect at the main carina extending directly into the esophagus. We then attempted to place a 15x12x12 hybrid dynamic Y stent into the airway to occlude the fistula by removing the rigid bronchoscope and using glide-scope laryngoscopy visualizing the vocal cords and directly passing the stent, secured with Freitag forceps, into the trachea. Once the stent was within the airway we inserted a  rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope through the vocal cords proximal to the stent. Due to the large defect at the main carina it was extremely difficult to seat the limbs within the bilateral mainstem and despite multiple attempts utilizing rigid forceps, reverse forceps CRE balloons and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we could not adequately seat the stent. The stent was removed and we then attempted to place a smaller 13X10X10 mm dynamic Y with a 5.5cm tracheal limb, a 2cm right sided limb and a 3cm left sided limb using a similar technique and were eventually able to secure the stent in place. Once this was accomplished a 6.5 ETT was inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope and advanced into the proximal limb of the stent and secured in place.   
Complications:  Extension of TE fistula 
Recommendations:
-        Patient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight.
-        Please obtain CXR once patient arrives in ICU
-        Please obtain CT chest prior to extubation if possible 
-        Appreciate GI recommendations. 
-        Please contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient. Anesthesia is also aware
-        Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.
-        If tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.
-        Please do not adjust the endotracheal tubes position or attempt suction unless absolutely necessary (tonight).
-        Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.
-        If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

Preoperative Diagnosis: Hemoptysis with subcarinal mass
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: • Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking
Surgeon: Lily Ashford, MD
Assistant: Gavin Mercer, MD (Attending)
Indications: Hemoptysis, significant airway obstruction, and need for tissue biopsy
Consent: Informed consent obtained from patient and family after detailed explanation of the procedure, associated risks, benefits, and alternatives.
Anesthesia:  General anesthesia 
Description of Procedure: Following induction of general anesthesia and insertion of an LMA, topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway. A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.
The video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.
Subsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.
The tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.
Persistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.
Following verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.
Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 30 cc
Post-procedure Recommendations: 
-	Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid.

CASE SUMMARY:
69-year-old woman with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency emphysema (PiZZ genotype), lower lobe predominant disease pattern.

TEACHING POINTS REVIEWED PRE-PROCEDURE:
1. Alpha-1 patients often have basilar predominant disease (unlike smoking-related emphysema)
2. Valve selection sizing based on CT measurements  
3. Chartis interpretation and decision-making
4. Complete vs. incomplete fissure implications

PRE-PROCEDURE CHECKLIST:
☑ Consent obtained and witnessed
☑ Sedation plan reviewed with anesthesia
☑ CT images loaded on workstation
☑ Valves available (multiple sizes)
☑ Chartis system prepared and tested
☑ Fluoroscopy operational
☑ Emergency equipment checked

PROCEDURE WALKTHROUGH:

STEP 1: Airway Assessment
Fellow performed systematic examination with attending supervision. Appropriate technique demonstrated for complete inspection.

STEP 2: Chartis Assessment  
Target: Left Lower Lobe
- Catheter advanced to LLL
- Balloon inflated to create seal at LLL orifice
- Baseline flow and resistance measured
- Results: Flow decay to <30mL/min = NEGATIVE CV
Teaching point: This indicates absent collateral ventilation and favorable for valve therapy

STEP 3: Bronchial Measurement & Valve Selection
CT-based measurements reviewed:
- LB6: 6.8mm diameter → 5.5mm valve selected
- LB8-10: 5.2mm diameter → 4.0mm valve selected

STEP 4: Valve Deployment (Fellow performed with guidance)
- First valve (LB6): Required repositioning due to initial incomplete seal. Good learning opportunity regarding deployment technique.
- Second valve (LB8-10): Successful first attempt with excellent technique
- Final bronchoscopy: Both valves well-positioned, complete occlusion confirmed

TEACHING POINTS POST-PROCEDURE:
1. Valve repositioning is common and not a complication
2. Visual confirmation of complete lobar occlusion is essential
3. Post-procedure care including steroid/antibiotic prophylaxis rationale
4. Expected timeline for symptom improvement (4-6 weeks typically)

FELLOW ASSESSMENT:
Demonstrated good procedural skills. Area for improvement: Pre-deployment assessment of valve orientation. Overall: Progressing well in BLVR competency.

"CASE PRESENTATION: Complex Navigation Bronchoscopy

PATIENT [REDACTED]:
A 64-year-old male (Case ID: [REDACTED], Synthetic Name: Martin Lee, MRN: [REDACTED], DOB: [REDACTED]) former smoker with 45 pack-year history presented with an incidentally discovered left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule.

IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS:
Computed tomography demonstrated a 17mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe superior segment without clear bronchus sign. Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.

PROCEDURAL APPROACH:
Given the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.

Sedation Protocol:
Deep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.

Technical Details:
The electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension™) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning id[REDACTED] optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.

The extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.

Radiation Exposure:
Total fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes
Dose-area product: 268 cGy·cm²
(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)

Sampling Protocol:
Following tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:
- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)
- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens
- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples

COMPLICATIONS:
Small apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was id[REDACTED] on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.

QUALITY METRICS:
- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved
- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)
- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete
- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology

DISCUSSION:
This case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.",0ab0061cee34b1d0,golden_215.json,structured,0.95,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 18 mm PET-avid right lower lobe posterior basal segment nodule in a patient with severe COPD, clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer, high surgical risk.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Local control of early-stage lung cancer in a nonsurgical candidate via transbronchial microwave ablation.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.5 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (Illumisite platform) with cone-beam CT guidance in a hybrid operating room.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right lower lobe nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, a therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced to the right lower lobe. The pre-procedural CT scan was loaded into the Illumisite navigation software and a target pathway to the posterior basal segment nodule was planned. Peripheral navigation achieved a bullseye view of the lesion after tomosynthesis-based correction of CT-to-body divergence. A CrossCountry needle was advanced approximately 1 cm beyond the lesion center under fluoroscopic and cone-beam CT guidance. The extended working channel was kept in position and an Emprint microwave ablation catheter was advanced until the ablation center was aligned with the lesion. A single 10-minute ablation at standard lung protocol power was delivered. Immediate cone-beam CT demonstrated a concentric ground-glass ablation zone with a minimal circumferential margin of approximately 6 mm. Repeat bronchoscopy showed no active bleeding and patent segmental airways.

Estimated blood loss: <5 mL.
Complications: None immediate. No pneumothorax on fluoroscopy.

Indication: Local treatment of presumed primary lung cancer in a medically inoperable patient.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (Illumisite platform) with cone-beam CT guidance.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: After endotracheal intubation, the navigation bronchoscope was advanced to the right lower lobe. The Illumisite system was used to register the pre-procedural CT and plan a pathway to the superior segment lesion. Initial navigation demonstrated CT-to-body divergence; a tomosynthesis acquisition was performed and the nodule position was updated. A CrossCountry needle was advanced into the lesion, and the extended working channel was positioned 1 cm beyond the nodule center. Two sequential ablations (10 minutes and 7 minutes) were performed with slight retraction of the catheter between ablations to elongate the ablation zone. Cone-beam CT confirmed an elongated ablation zone encompassing the 2.4 cm lesion with an approximate minimal margin of 5 to 6 mm. A small right apical pneumothorax was seen on the post-ablation scan, without hemodynamic compromise.

Estimated blood loss: <10 mL.

2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left upper lobe lingular nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: Following careful induction and low tidal-volume ventilation, the bronchoscope was advanced through the single-lumen endotracheal tube to the lingula. Navigation bronchoscopy and fluoroscopic tomosynthesis were used to align the extended working channel with the lesion. A transbronchial needle created a parenchymal tract, and the Emprint catheter was advanced. Because of the patient’s limited reserve, a single 8-minute ablation at standard power was chosen, minimizing procedure time while still targeting an adequate ablation zone.

Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (7.5 mm ETT).
Indication: Recurrent symptomatic left pneumothorax with persistent air leak and incomplete lung expansion despite appropriately positioned chest tube following recent LLL BLVR.
Background: The patient underwent LLL BLVR with four valves 14 days ago. She was discharged after an uncomplicated initial hospital course. She re-presented with pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea; CXR showed a moderate left pneumothorax, and a chest tube was placed. After several days on suction, there was persistent air leak and failure of the LLL to re-expand.
Procedure details: Under general anesthesia, a therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT. The left bronchial tree was inspected. Four Zephyr valves were visualized in the basilar and superior segmental bronchi of the LLL. Given the persistent air leak, all four valves were removed sequentially using valve retrieval forceps. Each valve was collapsed and withdrawn through the scope without difficulty. The underlying bronchi demonstrated mild inflammatory changes but no purulence.
Complications: No significant bleeding. Oxygenation and hemodynamics remained stable. Post-procedure CXR showed improved LLL expansion with the chest tube in place and no increase in pneumothorax size.

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of right lower paratracheal lymph node (station 4R) using Wang needle (CPT 31629)
INDICATION: Right upper lobe lung mass with PET-avid right lower paratracheal (4R) lymph node; mediastinal staging for suspected non-small cell lung cancer.

ANESTHESIA/SEDATION: Moderate sedation with IV midazolam and fentanyl. Topical lidocaine applied to upper airway. The patient breathed spontaneously via native airway with supplemental oxygen.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
After time-out and confirmation of consent, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced orally. The larynx and trachea were normal. The main carina was sharp. The right mainstem bronchus showed mild external impression along its medial wall consistent with the known 4R node; mucosa was intact. The remainder of the bronchial tree was free of obstructing lesions.

CONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):
A 21-gauge Wang TBNA needle was introduced through the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks (no EBUS), the right lower paratracheal (station 4R) node was targeted from the distal trachea and proximal right mainstem bronchus. Three passes were made with suction applied. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with visible tissue fragments.

ROSE: On-site cytology was available. ROSE demonstrated malignant epithelial cells compatible with non-small cell lung carcinoma in a lymphoid background, confirming adequacy after the second pass. A third pass was obtained for cell block.

SPECIMENS:
Station 4R conventional TBNA x3 passes submitted for cytology and cell block with reflex molecular studies.

COMPLICATIONS: Minimal self-limited bleeding from the puncture site; no hypoxia or arrhythmia. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigation was performed; this was conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.

INDICATION: PET-avid right lower paratracheal (4R) lymph node in a patient with known right upper lobe adenocarcinoma; confirmation of N2 disease prior to definitive therapy.

ANESTHESIA/SEDATION: General anesthesia with 8.0 ETT. Anesthesiology provided induction with propofol and rocuronium; patient mechanically ventilated throughout.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
Following a formal time-out, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea and main carina appeared normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed minimal extrinsic impression along its medial wall. No endobronchial tumor or secretions were seen in either lung.

CONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):
A 22-gauge Wang TBNA needle was passed through the bronchoscope working channel. Under anatomic landmark guidance only (no EBUS system used), the right lower paratracheal (4R) node was sampled via the distal trachea and proximal right mainstem bronchus. Four aspiration passes were performed with suction. All passes yielded blood-tinged material with tissue fragments adequate for cytology and cell block.

ROSE: Rapid on-site evaluation by cytology demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in a lymphoid background, confirming N2 involvement. Adequacy was established after the second pass; additional passes were dedicated to cell block and molecular testing.

SPECIMENS:
Station 4R conventional TBNA x4 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, immunohistochemistry, and molecular profiling.

COMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding or hypoxia. No linear EBUS, radial probe, or navigation was used; this was conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.

DISPOSITION/PLAN:
The patient was extubated in the OR and transferred to PACU in stable condition. Results will be reviewed with thoracic surgery and medical oncology; given confirmed N2 disease, multimodality therapy rather than primary surgery is anticipated.",6d35ffbb1790053e,golden_273.json,structured,0.95,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The single-use disposable Noah Galaxy bronchoscope was introduced into the airway. Navigational registration was performed using the electromagnetic field generator placed beneath the patient.

The scope was navigated to the approximate target location in the RLL (RB6) based on the pre-operative CT navigational plan. Registration accuracy: 3.8mm.

Once in the target vicinity, a Tool-in-Lesion Tomosynthesis (TiLT+) sweep was performed using the C-arm. The system generated an updated intra-operative 3D volume, revealing a 1.7cm divergence between the pre-op CT target and the actual lesion location due to atelectasis.

The augmented reality target was updated on the navigation screen to match real-time anatomy. Intra-operative tomosynthesis (TiLT) performed to update target location and correct for divergence.

The scope was adjusted to align with the corrected TiLT target. Confirmation of tool position was verified using the augmented fluoroscopy overlay provided by the TiLT system.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant Central Airway Obstruction

INDICATIONS: Airway stent occlusion 

Sedation: General Anesthesia

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The patients known Silicone Y-stent was well positioned. There was signifigant thich dry mucous with mild obstruction of the tracheal limb, moderate obstruction of the left bronchial limb and significant obstruction of the right bronchial limb and the telescoping right mainstem covered metallic stent. The right upper lobe was partially obstructed by the distal tip of the SEM but there was no evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia and all right sided segmental airways were patent without endobronchial disease. On the left the distal mainstem, lower lobe bronchi were patient without evidence of endobronchial disease. At the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe takeoff there was partially obstructive endobronchial tumor causing approximately 40% reduction in caliber which did not warrant treatment at this time. Through a combination of mechanical debulking with the bronchoscope tip, forceps debulking and use of sodium bicarbonate instillation the adhesive mucous was slowly removed, with near complete recanalization of the stents. Subsequently a mini BAL was performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe with 40cc instillation and 30cc return. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed to confirm the patient’s id[REDACTED], the procedure, and the location.
Following administration of intravenous medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, a P190 hybrid video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea appeared normal. The bronchoscope was advanced to the main carina, which was noted to have a sharp angle. The scope was then directed into the left mainstem bronchus, allowing visualization of all segments and subsegments of the left upper lobe, lingula, and lower lobe; no abnormalities were id[REDACTED] on the left side. The bronchoscope was withdrawn to the trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. All segments and subsegments of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes were examined. Purulent material was observed emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The bronchoscope was wedged in this segment, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 60 cc of instilled saline, yielding 20 cc of return fluid. During the lavage, a cavity was visualized in the superior segment of the right lower lobe containing a well-demarcated soft tissue mass with a granular texture, consistent with a mycetoma. The right airway anatomy was notable for fusion of the apical and posterior segments in the right upper lobe; aside from the cavity, no additional masses or lesions were id[REDACTED]. After thorough inspection, multiple forceps biopsies were obtained from the mass within the cavity. Moderate bleeding ensued and was effectively managed with 4 cc of epinephrine, 30 cc of iced saline, and wedging of the scope in the affected segment, which successfully controlled the hemorrhage.
The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure was completed without further incident. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications. At the conclusion, he was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.

The patient had been previously intubated for proceeding procedure. The UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, into the esophagus. Using the vascular anatomy the bronchoscope was directed to the area of the known paraesophageal mass abutting the aorta just below the left atrium.  The mass was well-visualized with ultrasound directly behind the aorta with a small window which the needle could be passed between the left atrium and aorta. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUS TBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation was non-diagnostic after multiple attempts.  We then removed the EBUS bronchoscope. The endotracheal tube was removed and a size I-Gel LMA was inserted. The P190 thin video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp.

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: Moderate
Total sedation medications: Versed 3mg, Fentanyl 75 mcg
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the nose, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. Topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. 
The patient’s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. During the procedure, the patient did develop some intermittent hypoxia, requiring attachment of the oxygen supply to the bronchoscope working channel for direct tracheal oxygen administration which resolved the hypoxia. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.
Complications: None
Recommendations:
-RTC [REDACTED] at 1000 with Dr. Trentacosta
-Plan for stent removal for 'holiday' in MOR [REDACTED] or earlier if symptoms require

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without and endoluminal obstruction. On the right there was minimal structuring of the BI . On the left the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded. Radial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation however due to the proximal obstruction dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a jagwire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point we performed APC to the left maintem followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly re-opened but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets however once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture. At this point to protect from major vascular bleeding we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax and in the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition. 
Recommendations:
-	Patient to remain intubated tonight 
-	CT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung.
-	Appreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery.
-	Please obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention. 
-	If patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight place left side down, intubate right main stem,",3639223713e05c07,golden_313.json,structured,0.95,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: broncho-esophageal(anastomosis) fistula s/p Ivor Lewis Esophagostomy  s/p occlusive left mainstem stent
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Flexible, self-expandable airway stent placement
INDICATIONS: broncho-esophageal(anastomosis) fistula with persistent leak despite esophageal stent
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives a flexible bronchoscope was passed through the patients tracheostomy tube and into the airways. The trachea was normal. Purulent secretions were seen throughout the airways. Once secretions were suctioned inspection of the right sided airways should multiple small endobronchial nodular lesions concerning for airway metastasis. On the left in the mid left mainstem a 1.5cm fistula was seen at the medial aspect of the posterior wall. Distally (similar to what was seen on the right) were multiple small endobronchial lesions with an appearance suggestive of malignancy. Multiple nodules from the left and right side were biopsied with flexible forceps and placed in formalin.  At this point we measured the length of the fistula and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the fistula within the left mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the selected area required to cover the fistula with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 14x30 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed slightly too proximally with the distal edge just covering the fistula. We then decided to place a second 14x40 Aero stent into the previously place stent to better cover the obstruction. This was done in a similar fashion. On inspection after placement the originally placed stent was noted to have been pushed distally by the second stent (more distal than desired and obstructing the orifice of the left upper and lower lobe. We then removed the 14x40 stent by grasping the proximal edge with forceps. The stent could not be retracted through the tracheostomy so the trach tube was removed and then the stent was pulled through the stoma, after which re re-inserted the trach over a bronchoscope and re-attached it to the ventilator. We then retraced the remaining 14x30 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent into proper position (within the left mainstem covering the fistula) with forceps. Once this was done and we were satisfied with the final result the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. We then turned the patient over to anesthesia service to recover and transfer back to the ICU.

INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.

•	Transfer patient back to ward room 
•	Await final pathology results  
•	Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.",46199c5ea20d0ec2,golden_314.json,structured,0.95,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

INDICATIONS: Extrinsic airway compression and suspected TE fistula.
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The right vocal cord was irregular appearing with small vocal cord nodule visualized.  The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was normal with the exception of some mild mucosal irregularity in distal 2cm of the posterior tracheal wall. Thick purulent material was seen pulling at the level of the carina and the proximal left mainstem. After clearing secretions a endobronchial mass which appeared to extend from the esophagus was visualized within the proximal left mainstem causing about 80% endobronchial obstruction.  Just proximal to that mass was a small area where GI contents could be seen entering the airway consistent with a small TE fistula.  This was only about 1-2 mm distal to the main carina.  After bypassing the main tumor within the proximal left mainstem which was about 1 cm in depth submucosal infiltration could be seen for approximately 4 cm within the left mainstem bronchi.  There were purulent thick secretions throughout the left-sided airways which were suctioned via trap and sent for culture.  The right mainstem was significantly obstructed (approximately 70%) extrinsically with the greatest degree obstruction just proximal to the right upper lobe takeoff.  The bronchus intermedius appeared uninvolved and was widely patent.  The right middle lobe was normal to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  In the proximal aspect of the right lower lobe was some black discoloration of the mucosa but did not appear to be malignant and there is no endobronchial disease or obstruction to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  
Following inspection the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea and advanced to the distal trachea and connected to the Jet ventilator.  The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. Forcep biopsies were taken of the proximal left mainstem mass.  Moderate bleeding was encountered which was treated with topical epinephrine.  After adequate samples were taken APC was used to burn and shave the lesion using the tip of the bronchoscope to remove the devascularized tissue as well as forceps to remove associated debris.  After debulking the left mainstem was approximately 90% patent throughout.  Due to the carinal involvement with fistulization as well as the right mainstem extrinsic obstruction decision was made to place a silicone Y stent into the airway. Measurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 40mm in the tracheal limb, 25mm in the right mainstem limb and 45mm in the left mainstem limb.  The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and we initially attempted to insert the stent using Freitag forceps with indirect laryngoscopy.  This was unsuccessful and at one point the stent was deployed within the proximal esophagus.  The LMA was removed at that point and an endotracheal tube inserted after which we navigated into the proximal esophagus with the flexible bronchoscope, id[REDACTED] the stent and removed with flexible forceps.  After aborting attempts at Freitag placement a 14 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the airway for dimensional stent deployment.  The Rigid bronchoscope was then advanced to the proximal right mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The Stent was well seated. The trachea and left mainstem were widely patent and the area of disease mucosa within the left mainstem was completely covered.  The right mainstem only improved in diameter to approximately 50% of normal due to continued extrinsic compression on the stent from her esophageal mass. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed.  After removal of the bronchoscope it was noted that the patient had a small laceration on her tongue which developed during the procedure.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was id[REDACTED] with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina’s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an [REDACTED] CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis.

The T180 theraputic flexible bronchoscope was insterted through the rigid bronchoscope and airway inspection was performed. The proximal and mid trachea were normal. There was tumor infiltration within the distal trachea just proximal to the main carina on the right lateral wall with slowly oozing blood visualized. That main carina was involved on the right side. The left sided aiways were normal.  The proximal right mainstem was completely obstructed with friable enbdobronchial tumor APC was used to burn and shave the tumor and flexible forceps were used for biopsy. As we slowly debulked the tumor it became clear that the involvement was extensive. Using the P90 slim bronchoscope we were able to bypass tumor using saline aliquots to stent the airway open and eventually could visualize the basilar segments of the lower lobe where persistent tumor was seen. Using a forgery balloon and the pullback method we were able to dilate the airway slightly and then using an 8,9,10 CRE balloon gently dilated the BI and RLL bronchus. While bleeding was encountered it was not brisk and was controlled with tropical TXA, epi and cold saline. While considering stent placement the patient’s blood pressure began to slowly drop despite increasing vasopressor requirement and patient went into PEA/Asystole.

The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  The proximal and mid left mainstem were normal. In the distal left mainstem a white fungating tumor was seen causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and extending from the left lower lobe bronchus to causing complete obstruction of the lingula and 80% obstruction of the left mainstem.  The LMA was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then utilized cryoextraction to remove large pieces of tumor piece meal. Most of the superficial tumor was avascular and did not bleed but as we continued debulking into less necrotic tumor mild bleeding occurred and was treated with cold saline flushes. After extensive debulking we were able to advance the bronchoscope into the lingula were some purulent secretions were seen and performed mini BAL.

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. The patient was positioned supine and underwent general anesthesia with an 8.5 mm ETT. Using the Olympus Q190 standard video-bronchoscope, the trachea was inspected and appeared clear. The left bronchial tree was visualized and found to be normal.
The right mainstem bronchus was clear, while the right upper lobe exhibited submucosal tumor growth with patent airways. The proximal bronchus intermedius (BI) displayed normal luminal structure with approximately 15% obstruction from extraluminal tumor. The distal BI was normal. The right middle lobe (RML) had 80% obstruction due to submucosal infiltration. The right lower lobe (RLL) was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor.
The bronchoscope was exchanged for an EBUS scope. A 2.5 cm lymph node in station 11R1 was id[REDACTED] and biopsied using a 22G ViziShot-2 needle. Five passes were performed, and rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignancy.
The procedure was then switched to a therapeutic bronchoscope (3.2 mm working channel). Forceps biopsies were taken from the proximal RLL, followed by tumor cryoextraction and ablation with argon plasma coagulation (APC). A Fogarty balloon catheter was used to remove distal tumor and debris. Airway dilation of the RLL was performed with an [REDACTED] mm Elation balloon dilator.
The RLL superior segment remained near-completely obstructed, but visualization revealed mostly uninvolved basilar segments with minimal tumor involvement. A 10 x 15 mm Aero stent was placed in the RLL, with the proximal edge positioned just distal to the RML and jailing the superior segment. The basilar segments were patent beyond the stent. The stent was further dilated using a [REDACTED] mm Elation balloon. Post-procedure, the RLL was approximately 85% patent.

The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. The super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational map created preprocedurally we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the right upper lobe nodule. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion.  A super dimension needle was then inserted through the bronchoscope and 0.75 milliliters of isocyanate Green were injected just below the pleura adjacent to the nodule for planned robotic surgical resection immediately following. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was turned over to cardiothoracic surgery.
