MRN: <MRN>
Date of Procedure: <DATE_TIME>
Location: Horizon University Medical Center – Main OR
Attending: Dr. Laura Brennan
Assistant: Dr. Miguel Santos (IP fellow)

Pre-procedure Diagnosis:
Malignant central airway obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus from biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma.

Post-procedure Diagnosis:
Same.

Procedure Performed:
Rigid bronchoscopy with mechanical debulking of endobronchial tumor (CPT 31640).

Anesthesia / Airway:
General anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade. Patient intubated with size 12 rigid bronchoscope; intermittent jet ventilation provided through the bronchoscope barrel. ASA class III.

Findings:
Exophytic, friable tumor arising from the medial wall of the left mainstem bronchus, extending 2.5 cm distal to the carina and causing approximately 90% luminal obstruction with distal mucus plugging. Right-sided airways patent.

Interventions:
The bevel of the rigid bronchoscope was used to perform repeated rigid coring and mechanical debulking passes through the tumor. Large pieces of tumor were removed with forceps and suction. A microdebrider was then introduced through the rigid scope to further debulk residual tumor until the lumen was widely patent. Overall, the tumor was debulked in piecemeal fashion with clear mechanical debulking and excision of obstructing tissue. No thermal ablation was used.

Hemostasis:
Mild oozing from the tumor base controlled with cold saline irrigation and topical epinephrine. No APC or laser therapy required.

Estimated Blood Loss:
25 mL.

Complications:
None immediate. No hypoxia or hemodynamic instability.

Post-procedure Airway Status:
Final left mainstem obstruction estimated at <20% with good visualization of segmental bronchi and restoration of airflow.

Disposition:
Extubated in the OR without difficulty and transferred to the ICU for overnight monitoring given high tumor burden and recent pneumonia.

Patient ID: <MRN>
Date of procedure: <DATE_TIME>
Attending physician: Dr. K. Osei
Assistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; anesthesia team; radiology technologist.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 9 mm pure ground-glass nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe in a patient with advanced emphysema and prior contralateral segmentectomy.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Parenchyma-sparing local ablation of a high-risk ground-glass lesion in a patient not suitable for repeat resection.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT confirmation.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: Following induction and intubation, the bronchoscope was advanced to the left lower lobe. Navigation bronchoscopy guided the catheter to the superior segment airway. A cone-beam CT acquisition confirmed the position of the extended working channel tip relative to the subtle ground-glass lesion. The extended working channel was advanced slightly beyond the lesion center and the Emprint catheter deployed. Given the small lesion size, two shorter ablations (6 minutes and 5 minutes) at standard power were delivered without repositioning. Post-ablation cone-beam CT showed a spherical ablation zone centered on the lesion with an estimated minimal margin of 5 to 6 mm. No significant parenchymal hemorrhage or airway compromise was seen.

"Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note
Procedure: Navigational bronchoscopy with microwave ablation of a peripheral right upper lobe nodule.
Indication: 2.1 cm PET-avid peripheral right upper lobe nodule in a patient with presumed early-stage non-small cell lung cancer who is a poor surgical candidate.
Patient: 74-year-old female with COPD and coronary artery disease.
Sedation/airway: General anesthesia with endotracheal tube.
Procedure description: Following induction of general anesthesia and ETT placement, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced and the tracheobronchial tree inspected. Using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, a steerable catheter was guided to a posterior segment right upper lobe peripheral target along a planned pathway. Radial EBUS was then deployed through the extended working channel, demonstrating a concentric ultrasound signal consistent with an in-lesion position. After confirming catheter position with cone-beam CT, the radial EBUS probe was removed and a microwave ablation catheter was advanced to the lesion. A single ablation cycle was performed at 65 W for 7 minutes. Real-time impedance changes and post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated an ablation zone encompassing the nodule with at least a 5 mm circumferential margin. The catheter and bronchoscope were removed. No biopsies or lavage were performed during this session.
Findings: Posterior segment right upper lobe peripheral nodule successfully targeted and treated with bronchoscopic microwave ablation; no endobronchial tumor in central airways.
Complications: None. No pneumothorax or significant bleeding identified on immediate post-procedure imaging.
Disposition: Extubated in the procedure suite and recovered in PACU; planned overnight observation on telemetry.

"Indications: Left upper lobe nodule 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 7 and 11L. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus Visioshot  EBUSTBNA 19 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then tried to visualize the FDG avid station 5 lymph node seen on PET CT through the pulmonary artery but were unable to clearly visualize the node and thus could not sample from the mainstem approach (transvascular). We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy. At this point the patient had lost her IV access and developed laryngospasm prompting us to bronchoscopically intubate the patient with a size 8.5 ETT which was easily passed through the vocal cords and into the lower trachea before being secured in place. The Q190 bronchscope was then advanced, using anatomical knowledge,  into the proximal left upper lobe adjacent to the station 5 lymph node and utilizing radial EBUS attempted to sample this node through an airway approach with a transbronchial needle approach. ROSE was unrevealing and we subsequently the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement was attempted once we were in the vicinity of the point of interest with radial ultrasound. The lesion however could not be adequately visualized. Multiple attempts to navigate to the lesion were unfruitful and we subsequently completed the procedure without attempting to sample the left upper lobe peripheral lesion. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Negative Staging EBUS on preliminary evaluation 
- Flexible bronchoscopy with unsuccessful electromagnetic navigation to the left upper nodule

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Bronchus Intermedius  from mucus. 
 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12 	300	12	100	10	15
 
RUL Mass: 
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 4.0 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 19G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric after initial needle puncture into the lesion.  The following features were noted: continuous margin, heterogenous echotexture.
 
Once a tunnel had been created into the lesion with TBNA as above, Transbronchial microwave ablation was performed of the nodule as below. 
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Microwave 	Medium Antenna 	90*C	20:00 min	Transbronchial Ablation of Nodule
 
 
Subsequently, RB2 was engaged.  And microwave catheter was placed in the lateral superior aspect of the lung mass. CBCT was done to confirm the location.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Virginia Richardson, a 79-year-old female patient, presented to Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Maria Santos, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.3 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 27 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 2L, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 19.0 millimeters in short axis and 23.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 22.7 millimeters in short axis and 13.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.8 millimeters in short axis and 24.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.0 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 08:45, for a total procedure time of 75 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Pentax EB-1990i) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 14.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 4L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 24.3 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Station 10R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 12.9 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 10L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 18.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed suspicious for malignancy. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 18.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.5 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via fluoroscopy.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 5 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of LUL pulmonary lesion

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Larry Anderson, a 82-year-old female patient, presented to Community Hospital in San Francisco, CA for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 23.3 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the posterior basal (B10) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 2.8. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 25 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 2.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:00.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 11.9 millimeters in short axis and 22.1 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 27.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 16.1 millimeters in short axis and 28.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.4 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:05, for a total procedure time of 125 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

Patient Identification: Mark Howard
Medical Record Number: <MRN>
Date of Birth: <DATE_TIME> (Age: 48 years)
Biological Sex: Female
Date of Procedure: <DATE_TIME>
Institution: Memorial Hospital, Dallas, TX

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 48-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 28.6 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RLL lateral basal (B9), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 8.9.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 4. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 10R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 17.1 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 11R demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 8.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed granuloma. Station 11L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 22.2 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma. Station 2R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 21.9 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 4L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 18.5 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed granuloma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 2.6 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RLL lateral basal (B9).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated adjacent visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (5 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 5 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RLL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of atypical cells
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On <DATE_TIME>, Ashley Sanders, a 68-year-old male patient, presented to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Cleveland, OH for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 29.4 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 43 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 15.5 millimeters in short axis and 31.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 21.7 millimeters in short axis and 14.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was identified measuring 20.5 millimeters in short axis and 29.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 11:36, for a total procedure time of 81 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.
