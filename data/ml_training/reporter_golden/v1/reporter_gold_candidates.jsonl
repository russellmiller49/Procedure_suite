However, repeat CT at 6 weeks showed migration of RB2 valve with incomplete occlusion. Patient noted return of dyspnea over past 2 weeks.\n\nIMAGING REVIEW:\nComparison CT demonstrates:\n- RB1 valve: Excellent position, maintained\n- RB2 valve: Migrated distally approximately 1.5cm  \n- RB3 valve: Excellent position, maintained\n- Result: Incomplete RUL occlusion with air flow to anterior segment\n\nPROCEDURE PLAN: Bronchoscopic valve repositioning/replacement\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy under moderate sedation. Original anatomy reviewed. \n\nFINDINGS:\n- RB1 and RB3 valves well-seated as expected\n- RB2 valve visible but clearly malpositioned in subsegmental bronchus\n- Surrounding granulation tissue present\n\nINTERVENTION:\nUsing specialized removal forceps, the migrated RB2 valve was carefully grasped at the retention hooks. Gentle rotational torque applied while maintaining steady traction. Valve successfully removed intact without mucosal injury.\n\nBronchus re-inspected: Mild granulation tissue at original deployment site. Conservative debridement performed with cytology brush.\n\nNEW VALVE PLACEMENT:\nAfter measuring, new 5.5mm Zephyr valve (one size larger than original 4.0mm) deployed in RB2 with improved wall contact and resistance to migration. Valve delivery system technique modified to ensure more proximal placement.\n\nCONFIRMATION:\nFinal bronchoscopy confirmed all three valves in excellent position with complete RUL occlusion.

right pleural effusion.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nRight pleural effusion. Pleura appeared grossly normal. Suspected malignant pleural disease remained the working diagnosis.\n\nPROCEDURE\nRight diagnostic thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with evacuation of pleural fluid and placement of a right-sided chest tube.\n\nANESTHESIA\n[General anesthesia / Moderate Sedation]. Local anesthetic infiltration was used at the incision site.\n\nMONITORING\nStandard monitoring was employed throughout the procedure.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nThere were no intraoperative complications. No immediate postoperative complications were observed.\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL\nThe patient was positioned appropriately and the right hemithorax was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Local anesthetic was infiltrated at the planned entry site. A single-port entry was created in the right lateral chest and a semi-rigid pleuroscope was introduced into the pleural space. The pleural cavity was inspected and the parietal, visceral, and diaphragmatic pleura were visualized; all appeared grossly normal. All accessible pleural fluid was evacuated under direct visualization. A right-sided chest tube was placed and secured. No air leak was detected and the lung expanded satisfactorily on visualization. The incision site was dressed in sterile fashion.\n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN\n1. Right pleural effusion: all visible pleural fluid was evacuated.\n2. Pleura appeared grossly normal; no focal lesions were identified for biopsy, and no pleural biopsies were performed.\n3. Right-sided chest tube in place; chest tube to water seal and connection to appropriate drainage system.\n4. Post-procedure chest radiograph was to be obtained to confirm tube position and lung expansion.\n5. The patient was to be admitted for monitoring with chest tube management on the floor. Chest tube removal was planned when output was consistently less than 150 mL per day and there was no air leak.\n6.
