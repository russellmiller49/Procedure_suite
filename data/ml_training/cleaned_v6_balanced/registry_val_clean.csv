Date: [DATE]
Patient: Elizabeth Morgan | [ID] | Age: 59F
Attending: Dr. Kevin Park, MD
Fellow: Dr. Jennifer Walsh, MD (PGY-6)
Location: MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX

INDICATION: Stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer with near-complete obstruction of left mainstem bronchus causing post-obstructive pneumonia and respiratory failure. Palliative airway recanalization.

PROCEDURE:
1. Rigid bronchoscopy
2. Tumor debulking with rigid coring/mechanical debridement
3. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) for hemostasis and tumor ablation
4. Balloon dilation
5. Silicone stent placement, left mainstem

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation

FINDINGS & PROCEDURE:
Under GA, rigid bronchoscope (12mm Dumon) introduced. 
- Trachea: Patent
- Carina: Normal
- Right lung: Patent
- Left mainstem: >95% occluded by exophytic, necrotic tumor arising from posterolateral wall

TUMOR DEBULKING:
Rigid coring performed to remove bulk of intraluminal tumor. Significant necrotic debris evacuated. APC (ERBE, 40W) applied for hemostasis and ablation of residual tumor at margins. Estimated 80% tumor removed with resulting lumen ~10mm.

BALLOON DILATION:
CRE balloon (15mm x 40mm) used to dilate narrowed segment to accept stent. 3 inflations at 6 ATM.

STENT PLACEMENT:
Novatech Dumon silicone stent (14mm x 40mm) deployed over the debulked segment. Good expansion. Proximal and distal ends 1cm beyond visible tumor.

POST-PROCEDURE:
- Pre-obstruction: >95%
- Post-procedure: <20% (patent stent lumen)
- LLL and lingula now ventilated

SPECIMENS: Tumor fragments to surgical pathology
COMPLICATIONS: Moderate bleeding - controlled with APC
EBL: 75mL
