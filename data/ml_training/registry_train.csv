"PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Thompson, David W. | MRN: 95-847-2631 | DOB: 12/07/1951
PROCEDURE DATE: September 28, 2025
LOCATION: University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA
PROCEDURALIST: Elizabeth Morrison, MD, PhD, FCCP, DABIP
ASSISTANT: Jennifer Lee, DO (IP Fellow, PGY-6)
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Robert Chang, MD, MBA

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule, segment RB9, measuring 2.7 x 2.4 cm on most recent CT imaging dated 09/15/2025, with associated spiculation and pleural tethering highly concerning for malignancy. Previous transthoracic needle biopsy performed on 08/30/2025 yielded diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 positive, confirming primary lung origin.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: As above

PROCEDURE(S) PERFORMED:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy with complete airway survey
2. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with real-time cone-beam CT guidance
3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmation of target lesion
4. Radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe peripheral nodule
5. Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment

CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:
This is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.

DETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:
Following standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.

Anesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.

Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from 09/20/2025 loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) identified and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.

Navigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.

Cone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.

Extended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.

Radiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90°C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation with vital signs: HR 72-85, BP 132/78 - 145/82, SpO2 98-100% on FiO2 0.6. End-tidal CO2 maintained 35-38 mmHg.

After completion of initial 8-minute cycle, probe repositioned 5mm posterior to treat overlapping zone and ensure complete ablation coverage of entire tumor volume plus 5mm margin. Second ablation cycle performed: 6 minutes, target temperature 90°C. Impedance monitoring again demonstrated appropriate curve. Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic changes throughout entire tumor volume consistent with coagulative necrosis. Ice-cream cone appearance of ablation zone well visualized extending beyond original tumor margins.

Guide sheath and EWC slowly withdrawn under direct bronchoscopic visualization. Careful inspection of airways performed showing mild mucosal hyperemia at catheter contact points but no evidence of perforation, significant edema, or active hemorrhage. Small amount of serosanguinous secretions suctioned from right lower lobe, estimated <10 mL total.

Airways irrigated with normal saline. Bronchoscope withdrawn and patient emerged from general anesthesia without complications. Following standard reversal and spontaneous ventilation recovery, patient successfully extubated with good cough and gag reflexes. Transferred to post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition with oxygen saturation 94% on 2L NC.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal, less than 15 milliliters
INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS ADMINISTERED: 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution
SPECIMENS SENT: None
COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively

FINDINGS:
1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RLL lateral basal segment target lesion
2. Radiofrequency ablation completed per protocol with two overlapping ablation zones
3. Good real-time monitoring throughout with appropriate impedance and temperature curves
4. Post-ablation imaging demonstrates adequate treatment zone with apparent complete coverage
5. No immediate procedural complications identified

ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
74-year-old gentleman with biopsy-proven RLL peripheral adenocarcinoma, poor surgical candidate, status post successful bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation. Procedure technically successful with good positioning and ablation parameters. Patient tolerated procedure well without complications.

PLAN:
1. Admit to Pulmonary Intermediate Care Unit (7 East) for overnight observation
2. Continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry monitoring overnight
3. Chest radiograph in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax or other acute complications
4. CT chest with intravenous contrast in 24 hours to assess ablation zone and rule out complications
5. Pain management: scheduled acetaminophen 1000mg q8h, oxycodone 5mg q6h PRN moderate pain, hydromorphone 0.5mg IV q4h PRN severe pain
6. Aggressive pulmonary toilet: incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake, chest physiotherapy as needed
7. Empiric antibiotics NOT indicated at this time given low infection risk
8. Anticipated discharge tomorrow if overnight course uncomplicated and CT scan reassuring
9. Follow-up arrangements: Clinic visit in 1 week with CXR, CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment, PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response
10. Continue home medications including COPD regimen, cardiac medications
11. Patient and family extensively counseled on post-procedure expectations, warning signs for complications (increasing dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis), importance of follow-up

I have personally performed and supervised this entire procedure. All findings, interventions, and recommendations above represent my direct involvement and assessment.

1.	Severe tracheobronchomalacia 
2.	Airway stent partial obstruction from granulation tissue
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Severe tracheobronchomalacia  status post tracheal Y-stent removal
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.	Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with  Tracheal stent removal
2.	Cryotherapy to granulation tissue
SURGEON: Jessica Muller, MD 
Assistant: Jeffery Tran MD (fellow)
INDICATIONS:  Airway stent partial obstruction from granulation tissue
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient’s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty and was fully intact.  Once his stent was removed the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted for repeat airway inspection. There was significant (near complete dynamic airway collapse of the trachea and mainstem bronchi as expected given known TBM.  The 1.9mm flexible cryoprobe was inserted through the working channel and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue with 30 second freeze thaw times and at least 3 activations per site. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Complications: None
Recommendations:
- Transfer back to PACU and then to wards
-  Plan for stent holiday to allow healing of granulation tissue and based on symptoms possible replacement of the stent sometime in the future.

NAME: Gilbert Barkley
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial obstruction
 
PROCEDURE(s) PERFORMED: 
SURGEON: Mikie Gallegos, MD 
ASSISTANT(s):  Stephen Pressly M.D., Nicholas Vance M.D,
INDICATIONS:  Airway stent removal
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
SEDATION: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record, a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. 
Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle bronchi had stent in place with minimal mucous but granulation tissue the distal edge causing 50% obstruction. The right lower lobe bronchi stent was partially obstructed with thick yellow mucous. Using saline flushes and suction we were able to remove mucous. The right middle lobe stent was then grasped with flexible forceps by the proximal string and retracted. The stent was easily removed. There was significant inflammation and malacia at site of previous stent. The bronchoscope was advanced beyond the stenotic segment and the medial and lateral segments were visualized and intact.  The Right lower lobe stent was then removed in a similar fashion to the RML stent without difficulty. In the previous bed there was extensive inflammation and granulation tissue causing >50% obstruction of the airway. The bronchoscope was pushed through the obstruction using saline flushes and the distal basilar segments were visualized and intact. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were debulked with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps. During this process the superior segment of the RLL was visualized with sub-segments intact. There remained significant obstruction and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue using repetitive 30 second freeze thaw cycles. This was performed in a similar manner in the RML. Finally, using an 8-9-10 CRE dilatational balloon we were able to gently dilate the effected bronchi to increased luminal diameter. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.
RESULTS: Successful removal of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi with significant residual granulation tissue.
COMPLICATIONS: None
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- To PACU for recovery
- D/C when criteria met
- Ok to return to Hawaii on Monday if asymptomatic over weekend. 
- Recommend repeat flexible bronchoscopy with pulmonologist at Tripler within the next week to remove debris following cryotherapy.

Malignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)
Right malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells

The patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.
MULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING
Pre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:

Address airway obstruction first (most critical)
Follow with pericardial window creation
Complete with PleurX catheter placement if patient tolerates

INFORMED CONSENT
Extensive discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy) on 10/24/2024 at 16:00. Risks discussed in detail:

Bleeding (estimated 5-10% risk given tumor vascularity)
Perforation or pneumothorax (5% risk)
Arrhythmia during pericardial procedure (10-15%)
Hypoxemia or respiratory failure (moderate risk given baseline status)
Need for ICU care postoperatively (expected)
Mortality risk (~2-5% given complexity and comorbidities)

Benefits reviewed: Improved breathing, reduced cardiac compromise, palliation of symptoms.
Alternatives discussed: No intervention (continued clinical decline), staged procedures (multiple anesthetic exposures).
Patient and daughter understood risks and expressed wish to proceed. Written consent obtained and witnessed.

"OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE
PART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)
Patient brought to hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:

Correct patient (ID band, verbal confirmation)
Procedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)
Positioning (supine throughout)
Antibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)
Steroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)
Blood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)

Initial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.
Initial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:
Olympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:

Supraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions
Vocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses
Subglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis
Trachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions
Carina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy
Left main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter
LUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent
Right main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.

Decision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.
Rigid Bronchoscopy Phase:
Patient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.
Ventilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.
The rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.
Mechanical Debridement:
Using the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.
Estimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue
Hemostasis Measures:
As expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:

Iced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.
Topical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.
Tranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.

After approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.
Electrocautery:
Flexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.
Treatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus
Treatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time
Effect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis
Argon Plasma Coagulation:
APC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.
Treatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.
Duration: 6 minutes active APC time
Result: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface
Assessment after debridement:
Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.
Balloon Dilation:
Boston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.
Inflation sequence:

First inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Second inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Third inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)

Fluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.
Post-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.
Stent Placement:
After discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.
Stent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length
Deployment technique:

Stent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance
Positioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus
Fluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views
Slow, controlled deployment under direct visualization
Post-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion

Post-stent assessment:
Flexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.
Findings:

Stent well-positioned, no migration
Excellent apposition to airway walls
RUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent
RML orifice: Visible and patent
RLL orifice: Visible and patent
All segments of right lung now visualized for first time
Significant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)

Therapeutic Aspiration:
Extensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:

Right upper lobe: Approximately 30mL
Right middle lobe: Approximately 20mL
Right lower lobe: Approximately 40mL

Total secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.
Final Airway Inspection:

Trachea: Normal
Left bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent
Right main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)
RUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation
Minimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent

Rigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).
Airway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM
Estimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL
Specimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)

PART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)
Patient repositioned with arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.
TEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
Surgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):

Subxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm
Dissection carried down to pericardium
Pericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created
Rush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid
Pericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)
No active bleeding from pericardial surface
19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space
Drain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction

TEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.

PART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)
With patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.
Ultrasound examination (performed by IP team):

Right hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion
Estimated volume: 1000-1200mL
Anechoic fluid, no loculations
Compressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)

PleurX catheter placement:
Standard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Exit site: 5cm anterior. Catheter advanced 15cm into pleural space.
Initial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).
Chest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures. Occlusive dressing applied.

PROCEDURE CONCLUSION
All procedures completed successfully. Total operative time: 4 hours 15 minutes.
Patient Status at Conclusion:

Hemodynamically stable (MAP 78, HR 82)
Improved oxygen saturation: 96% on FiO2 0.5 (compared to pre-procedure 88% on FiO2 1.0)

POSTOPERATIVE DISPOSITION & PLAN
Immediate (ICU):

Extubate when fully awake and following commands (anticipated within 2-4 hours)
Chest X-ray immediately post-procedure and daily x3 days
Monitor pericardial drain output
Pleural catheter to drain q3 days initially
Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (started on Pip-Tazo for post-obstructive pneumonia)
DVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ
PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry

Short-term (Inpatient, 3-5 days):

Remove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day
Transition to floor when stable
Continue PleurX catheter drainage
Pain control
Physical therapy for reconditioning

Medium-term (1-2 weeks):

Discharge with home health for PleurX catheter management
Follow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray
Discuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved

Long-term:

Surveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent
Monitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)
May need stent revision/exchange
PleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life


ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
Mrs. Okafor presented with critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:

Near-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction → Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent
Cardiac tamponade physiology → Successfully addressed with pericardial window
Large pleural effusion → Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter

All procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:

Restored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)
Resolution of cardiac compromise
Control of pleural effusion

Prognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.
The patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT
I, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement. I assisted the cardiothoracic surgery team during pericardial window creation.
The procedure was medically necessary, technically indicated, and appropriately performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.

**PHASE 1 - EBUS:**

Surveyed mediastinum systematically.

Station 7 (subcarinal):
- 21 x 18mm, hypoechoic, round
- 22G needle, 5 passes
- ROSE (Dr. Williams): ""Positive for malignancy. Adenocarcinoma cells. CK7+/CK20- pattern on rapid IHC. Cannot definitively distinguish breast met vs lung primary on cytology alone - recommend tissue biopsy with full IHC panel.""

Other stations surveyed - no other enlarged nodes.

**PHASE 2 - EMN to RLL nodule:**

SuperDimension system. CT from 04/30/25 loaded.
Target: RLL lateral basal segment nodule.

Registration: Auto, 8 points, good accuracy.

Navigated to target - distance 0.7cm per system.

Radial EBUS: Concentric pattern, 26mm heterogeneous lesion.

Sampling:
- TBBx x 8 (formalin - **REQUEST FULL IHC PANEL: TTF-1, Napsin-A, CK7, CK20, ER, PR, HER2, GATA-3, Mammaglobin**)
- Brushings x 3
- BAL

ROSE: ""Adenocarcinoma. Morphology could represent either primary lung or breast metastasis. IHC panel will be definitive.""

No complications. CXR: no PTX.

**IMPRESSION:**
Adenocarcinoma in both subcarinal node and RLL nodule. Awaiting IHC to determine if breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.

If breast metastasis → continue systemic breast cancer therapy
If primary lung cancer → separate staging/treatment approach needed

**PLAN:**
- IHC panel expedited (results expected 05/09)
- Contact patient with results
- Tumor board if lung primary confirmed
- Close communication with medical oncology

**Nodal Staging Summary:** Extensive disease - N1, N2, and N3 all involved
**Part 2: Standard Airway Survey**

EBUS scope removed. Therapeutic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) inserted.

**Finding:** LUL orifice shows exophytic endobronchial tumor - fungating mass with areas of necrosis, nearly occluding lingual ostium.

**Endobronchial Biopsy:**

Given visible endobronchial component, obtained direct biopsies before proceeding to EMN:
- 6 forceps biopsies from endobronchial tumor
- Friable tissue, moderate bleeding
- Managed with epinephrine 1:10,000 5mL + wedging scope
- Hemostasis achieved

ROSE: ""Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples""
**Part 3: EMN to Cavitary Component**

Despite endobronchial biopsy being diagnostic, proceeded with EMN to sample cavitary/necrotic component given potential for different biology/infectious etiology.

SuperDimension system. CT from 05/20/2025.

Registration: Automatic, 7 points confirmed.

Target: LUL apical-posterior segment (cavitary portion of mass).

Navigation: Challenging due to tumor distortion of anatomy. Unable to reach planned depth (tumor blocking). Achieved position ~12mm from target per system.

Radial EBUS: Eccentric pattern, visualizing mass edge/cavity wall.

Sampling through guide sheath:
- Forceps biopsies x 5 (from cavity wall)
- Brushings x 2
- BAL x 100cc (sent for bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures + cytology)

ROSE: ""Squamous cell carcinoma, areas of necrosis""
**COMPLETION:**

Total time: 64 minutes
Moderate bleeding from endobronchial site - resolved
Patient extubated, stable

**EBL:** ~40mL

**SPECIMENS:**

3. Station 7 TBNA x4
4. Station 10L TBNA x3
5. LUL endobronchial biopsies x6
6. LUL cavity wall biopsies (EMN) x5
7. LUL brushings x2
8. LUL BAL (cultures + cytology)

**REQUEST PD-L1 testing on tumor specimens**

**COMPLICATIONS:** Moderate endobronchial bleeding - controlled

**POST-OP CXR:** No pneumothorax. Known LUL cavitary mass unchanged.
**FINDINGS:**

**Diagnosis:** Squamous cell carcinoma of LUL with extensive nodal metastases

**Staging:**
- T: T3 (4.3cm with cavitation)
- N: N3 (contralateral mediastinal node station 4L positive)
- M: M0 (pending complete staging)
- **Stage: IIIB (T3N3M0)**

**Characteristics:**
- Cavitary lesion (concerning - DDx includes post-obstructive pneumonia, tumor necrosis)
- Endobronchial extension with near-obstruction
- Extensive nodal disease

**NOT A SURGICAL CANDIDATE** - Stage IIIB with N3 disease
**PLAN:**

**Immediate:**
- Monitor for post-procedure bleeding (patient with prior hemoptysis)
- Continue observation overnight given bleeding during procedure
- F/u CXR in AM

**Staging:**
- Brain MRI
- Complete PET/CT review (ensure no distant mets)

**Infectious Work-up:**
- Culture results pending (bacterial/fungal/AFB from BAL)
- Consider CT-guided drainage if abscess component identified
- Empiric antibiotics if clinical signs of post-obstructive pneumonia

**Oncologic:**
- Medical oncology urgent consult
- Radiation oncology consult
- Definitive concurrent chemoradiation (platinum-doublet + RT)
- PD-L1 results will guide immunotherapy consideration
- Hemoptysis precautions - may need palliative RT if worsens

**Follow-up:**
- IP clinic 1 week
- Earlier if concerning symptoms (increased hemoptysis, fever, dyspnea)

**Prognosis Discussion:**
- Stage IIIB - locally advanced
- Not curable with surgery
- Chemoradiation can provide long-term control in some patients
- Will need frank discussion of prognosis and goals of care

"PATIENT: Emma Thompson, 3-year-old Female
MRN: 9238176
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Emma is a 3-year-old female presenting with sudden onset cough and wheezing 2 days ago while eating peanuts. CXR shows hyperinflation of the right lung with mediastinal shift. CT chest confirms suspected foreign body in right mainstem bronchus. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to rigid bronchoscopy for foreign body removal were discussed with the patient's parents in detail. Parents indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration, right mainstem bronchus
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body aspiration (peanut fragment), right mainstem bronchus
PROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy with Foreign Body Removal
ATTENDING: Dr. Steven Martinez
ASSISTANT: Dr. Laura White, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Katherine Brown
RT: Andrew Garcia
Anesthesia: Dr. Michelle Chen

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring
INSTRUMENT: Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope (3.5mm), optical forceps, foreign body forceps
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <5 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll, neck extended
A 3.5mm Storz pediatric rigid bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth under direct laryngoscopy. The vocal cords were visualized and appeared normal with symmetric movement. The bronchoscope was advanced through the cords into the trachea.
Initial Survey:

Larynx: Normal
Vocal cords: Normal, symmetric movement
Trachea: Normal caliber, no lesions
Carina: Sharp, normal

The bronchoscope was advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. A foreign body was visualized 2cm distal to the carina - a tan-brown, irregular object consistent with a peanut fragment, approximately 8mm in size. The foreign body was partially occluding the right mainstem bronchus with surrounding mucosal edema and mild erythema.
Foreign Body Retrieval:
Optical forceps were advanced through the rigid bronchoscope. The peanut fragment was grasped carefully. Initial attempt at retrieval showed the fragment was somewhat friable. The fragment was gently manipulated and brought into the rigid bronchoscope barrel to prevent fragmentation. The bronchoscope and forceps with the foreign body were withdrawn as a single unit.
The foreign body was removed intact - a peanut fragment measuring approximately 8mm x 5mm.
The bronchoscope was reintroduced for inspection:

Right mainstem: Mild mucosal edema and erythema at the site, no residual foreign material
Right upper lobe: Patent
Right middle lobe: Patent
Right lower lobe: Patent with moderate secretions
Left lung: Examined and found to be normal

Secretions were suctioned from the right lower lobe. No other foreign material was identified. Final inspection showed:

Complete foreign body removal
Mild mucosal trauma with no active bleeding
Patent bilateral airways

The bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room.
The attending, Dr. Martinez, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S):

Foreign body: Peanut fragment (retained for documentation)

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Emma underwent successful rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal. A peanut fragment was removed from the right mainstem bronchus without complication. Post-procedure CXR ordered to confirm resolution of hyperinflation. Observe overnight with monitoring. Discharge tomorrow if stable. No bronchodilators needed. Counsel parents on choking prevention.

"Patient Name: Christopher Hayes
MRN: 9274183
Date of Procedure: June 15, 2020

Preoperative Diagnosis: Bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Postoperative Diagnosis: Bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy

Surgeon: Kevin Martinez, MD
Indications: Left mainstem obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. I-gel LMA was placed for initial airway inspection and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The upper trachea was normal. The distal third of the trachea was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern but without any endoluminal obstruction. On the right, there was minimal structuring of the bronchus intermedius. On the left, the proximal mainstem was about 90% obstructed circumferentially, and approximately 1 cm into the left mainstem the airway was completely occluded.

Radial knife cuts were performed within the proximal left mainstem followed by attempted CRE balloon dilatation. However, due to the proximal obstruction, dilatation was difficult as only the balloon tip could be inserted into the left mainstem due to the complete distal obstruction. We attempted to place a guide wire through the obstruction as well but unsuccessfully.

The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. At this point, we performed APC to the left mainstem followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly recanalize the airway. We periodically would reinsert the CRE balloon and dilate as the airway lumen slowly reopened, but we were unable to visualize any distal airway. This was performed in a slow methodical fashion given the concern for airway perforation without obvious distal airway targets. However, once we had dilated approximately 3 cm into the left mainstem, a pulsatile vessel was seen which was likely the pulmonary artery through a small (2 mm) false lumen. The PA was intact and there was no evidence of rupture.

At this point, to protect from major vascular bleeding, we instilled fibrin glue into the left mainstem, after which we removed the rigid bronchoscope and intubated the patient. Chest radiograph was performed which showed his previously elevated left hemi-diaphragm was significantly lower and there was a questionable deep sulcus concerning for pneumothorax. In the setting of a known airway tear and need for positive pressure ventilation, we felt that chest tube placement was warranted. After prepping the left mid-axillary area, a 14F pigtail catheter was placed without complications and the patient was transferred to the PICU in stable condition.

Recommendations:
• Patient to remain intubated tonight
• CT surgery aware and will evaluate patient for possible pneumonectomy given airway injury and lack of viable lung
• Appreciate Rheumatology recommendations in regards to tapering immunosuppressives in anticipation of possible surgery
• Please obtain CT chest with contrast once stable to assist in planning for possible surgical intervention
• If patient develops significant hemoptysis tonight, place left side down, intubate right mainstem, call me (602-791-3135) and pediatric surgeon immediately
• We will continue to follow

NAME: McBee, Jessica  MRN: 12245954

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.        Esophageal stent migration through distal trachea and left mainstem
2.         Left mainstem occlusion secondary to  esophageal stent
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.        Tracheoesophageal fistula status post tracheal Y-stent placement
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.        Rigid bronchoscopy with esophageal stent removal 
2.        Dynamic Y ( hybrid) Tracheal stent placement
3.        Bronchoscopic intubation
SURGEON: Jordan Parks MD
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction secondary to esophageal stent migration
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina an esophageal stent was visualized protruding into the airway causing approximately 30% obstruction of the distal trachea. On closer inspection we could visualize both of the patients telescoping esophageal stent. The proximal end of the inner covered stent could be seen with the origin of the lumen approximately 50% into the airway. The outer uncovered stents proximal origin was seen about 5mm into the distal left mainstem. Additionally a large clip attached to the uncovered outer stent could be seen within the airway. The stents traversed into the left mainstem causing complete occlusion which we could not bypass with the flexible bronchoscope. Bronchial lavage was performed to collect purulent secretions from the airway. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Using flexible forceps we were able to detach and remove the clip. We were aware that the outer uncovered stent was embedded into the trachea and could not be removed. However, given that the inner stents proximal lumen was within the airway and that this stent was not known to be fixed to tissue we chose to attempt the remove the stent enblock through the airway. Using the rigid forceps the proximal edge of the stent was grasped and slowly withdrawn. Initially the stent moved easily however after retracting approximately 3cm of the stent sudden resistance was encountered and the proximal edge of the stent fractured. Given that a much longer segment of the stent was now within the trachea causing significant obstruction (which also now made placement of a tracheal stent impossible) we had no choice except to attempt to further extract the stent. The stent however was firmly fixed and retraction resulted in further fracture with multiple exposed sires within the trachea. Advanced GI endoscopy was called and came to the OR. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an EGD was performed. The proximal edge of the outer uncovered stent  from the esophageal side was embedded and distorted and could not be passed even with the Ultra slim (6mm) gastroscope.  The rigid bronchoscope was reinserted during EGD to better allow us to visualize the communication and attempt to pass a wire in into the esophagus to place an additional stent but the wire would only pass into the airway and this was subsequently aborted leaving us no choice but to continue to remove the esophageal stent piecemeal. Using multiple techniques to include rigid endoscopic scissors, APC, and forceps we slowly removed exposed wires and attempted to transect the stent to allow airway stent placement. This was extremely difficult as more and more unraveling stent was seen. As both stents migrated further into the airway while extracting exposed wires the majority of the stents had to be removed in a piecemeal fashion. Once the stents were removed, with the exception of some small distal wires, the extent of the fistula (which extended during extraction) became completely apparent with the posterior wall of the trachea essentially absent in the lower third with a large defect at the main carina extending directly into the esophagus. We then attempted to place a 15x12x12 hybrid dynamic Y stent into the airway to occlude the fistula by removing the rigid bronchoscope and using glide-scope laryngoscopy visualizing the vocal cords and directly passing the stent, secured with Freitag forceps, into the trachea. Once the stent was within the airway we inserted a  rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope through the vocal cords proximal to the stent. Due to the large defect at the main carina it was extremely difficult to seat the limbs within the bilateral mainstem and despite multiple attempts utilizing rigid forceps, reverse forceps CRE balloons and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we could not adequately seat the stent. The stent was removed and we then attempted to place a smaller 13X10X10 mm dynamic Y with a 5.5cm tracheal limb, a 2cm right sided limb and a 3cm left sided limb using a similar technique and were eventually able to secure the stent in place. Once this was accomplished a 6.5 ETT was inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope and advanced into the proximal limb of the stent and secured in place.   
Complications:  Extension of TE fistula 
Recommendations:
-        Patient to remain on positive pressure ventilation tonight.
-        Please obtain CXR once patient arrives in ICU
-        Please obtain CT chest prior to extubation if possible 
-        Appreciate GI recommendations. 
-        Please contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient. Anesthesia is also aware
-        Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.
-        If tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.
-        Please do not adjust the endotracheal tubes position or attempt suction unless absolutely necessary (tonight).
-        Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.
-        If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Flexible bronchoscopy with radial knife incisions and balloon dilatation SURGEON: Russell Miller, MD 
INDICATIONS: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis Stenosis 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp. On the right there was mucosal changes/eryethema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared un-effected. The BI was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without There was mild structuring on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior and lateral and posterior basal segments partially obstructed from stricture (50%). On the left the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingual was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected. 
Following inspection we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3cm length with a 12,13.5,15 CRE balloon with post dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band like strictures within the lingual, the superior segment of the right lower lobe medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6,7,8 CRE balloon to the lingual, the superior segment of the right lower lobe medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily by passed into the segments. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant central airway obstruction.  
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y- stent placement 
SURGEON: Russell Miller, MD
INDICATIONS: Airway obstruction
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation) we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and has to convert to a 12mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.  Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.  It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression. Tumor debulking  was performed using APC to  “burn and shave” the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.
Once we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved. 
After measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position. Post-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery. 

Recommendations:
-          Transfer back to ICU
-          Post-procedure x-ray
-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.
-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.
-	If invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

Preoperative Diagnosis: Hemoptysis with subcarinal mass
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: • Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking
Surgeon: Lily Ashford, MD
Assistant: Gavin Mercer, MD (Attending)
Indications: Hemoptysis, significant airway obstruction, and need for tissue biopsy
Consent: Informed consent obtained from patient and family after detailed explanation of the procedure, associated risks, benefits, and alternatives.
Anesthesia:  General anesthesia 
Description of Procedure: Following induction of general anesthesia and insertion of an LMA, topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway. A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.
The video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.
Subsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.
The tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.
Persistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.
Following verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.
Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 30 cc
Post-procedure Recommendations: 
-	Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid. 
-	Await pathology results. 
-	Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula secondary to esophageal CA 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula secondary to esophageal CA 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, Tracheal self-expandable airway stent removal
SURGEON: Mikie Gallegos, MD
INDICATIONS: Stent migration and presumed stent infection
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords the patients previous stent could be visualized. Throughout the stent were thick purulent material consistent with infection. The telescoped distal tracheal stent was noted to have migrated into the right mainstem causing complete occlusion of the left mainstem. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid and into the stent. Bronchial lavage was performed with specimen obtained by trap and sent for culture. The proximal edge of the distal telescoped stent was visualized and using flexible forceps we secured the proximal knot and attempted to withdraw the stent. The stent moved only slightly but enough to visualize copious amounts of post-obstructive pus being expressed from the previously obstructed left mainstem. The material was collected in a trap for culture. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps. The proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent. Both stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope. The airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass. The patient’s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula. The airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 

Post procedure diagnosis:
-	Stent infection
-	Stent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.
-	Persistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent 
-	s/p airway stent removal
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Await cultures
- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula
- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.

Indications: Right sided Pleural effusion
Medications: As per anesthesia record
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the left lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  An 8 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 1600cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had diffuse carcinomatosis with multiple hard white pleural nodules covering the parietal and visceral pleura.  No adhesions were present Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 12 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, the pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly.

• CPT 31627 Bronchoscopy with computer assisted image guided navigation
• CPT 31654 Bronchoscopy with Endobronchial Ultrasound guidance for peripheral lesion
• CPT 31624 Bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage

Indications: Migratory lung nodules
Medications: General Anesthesia

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.

Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there were no endobronchial lesions. There were thick non-purulent secretions in multiple airways which were suctioned.

Following inspection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180 cc instillation and 70 cc return. The SuperDimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software, we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest. Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen. Subsequently, further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation. After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc

Recommendation:
• CXR to rule out pneumothorax
• Await pathology results

**INSTITUTION:** University Hospital San Antonio

**ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:** Dr. Patricia Nguyen, MD (Interventional Pulmonology)

**INDICATION:**
54-year-old male with history of cirrhosis (MELD 18) presenting with recurrent hepatic hydrothorax. Right-sided pleural effusion causing moderate dyspnea.

**PRE-PROCEDURE:**
- Informed consent obtained with discussion of increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia (platelets 68K) and coagulopathy (INR 1.7)
- Timeout performed
- Point-of-care ultrasound revealed right pleural effusion, maximum depth 6.5 cm
- Labs reviewed: Platelets 68K, INR 1.7, Creatinine 1.2
- Vital signs: BP 118/72, HR 76, SpO2 91% on 2L NC

**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**
- Patient positioned sitting, leaning forward
- Right lateral chest, 7th intercosal space, posterior axillary line
- Chlorhexidine skin prep
- Local anesthesia: 12 mL of 1% lidocaine
- Ultrasound-guided insertion of 8-French catheter system
- Initial fluid: transudative appearance, clear yellow
- Volume removed: 800 mL (stopped due to concern for re-expansion pulmonary edema)
- Drainage rate kept slow (less than 1000 mL/hour)
- Post-procedure ultrasound: no pneumothorax

**SPECIMENS SENT:**
- Pleural fluid analysis (cell count, protein, LDH, albumin)
- Pleural fluid culture

**IMMEDIATE RESULTS:**
- Appearance: Clear, yellow, transudative
- Estimated protein <2.5 g/dL based on appearance

**POST-PROCEDURE:**
- Procedure well tolerated
- No immediate complications
- Vital signs: BP 122/74, HR 78, SpO2 94% on 2L NC
- Patient reports significant improvement in breathing

**COMPLICATIONS:** None

**ASSESSMENT:** Successful therapeutic thoracentesis of recurrent hepatic hydrothorax. Limited drainage to 800 mL to minimize risk of complications given underlying coagulopathy and hepatic disease.

**PLAN:**
- Continue diuretic optimization
- Discuss with hepatology regarding TIPS evaluation
- Consider repeat thoracentesis vs IPC if rapid reaccumulation
- Sodium restriction and fluid management",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Patient Name: James Patterson
MRN: 4726193
Date: May 29, 2019

Preoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor
Postoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation (CPT 31641)

Surgeon: Patricia Lee, MD
Assistant: Marcus Johnson, MD
Indications: Tracheal obstruction
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics, the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords, there were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation, resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway. Additionally, there were multiple small polypoid (>50) lesions surrounding and distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1 cm proximal to the main carina. The right-sided and left-sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.

The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions. The lesions, once free from the wall, were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed, about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure, the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.

Of note, we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect as the lesions regrew very quickly (<3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure. However, in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure, he expressed reluctance to have a stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation, and if I need to debulk again, I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.

Recommendations:
• Transfer patient back to ward room
• Await final pathology results
• Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy

I, Patricia Lee, MD, was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial obstruction
 
PROCEDURE(s) PERFORMED: 
SURGEON: Mikie Gallegos, MD 
ASSISTANT(s):  Stephen Pressly M.D., Nicholas Vance M.D,

NDICATIONS:  right middle lobe and right lower lobe stenosis
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
SEDATION: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record, the endotracheal tube previously in place was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. 
Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. There was significant distortion of the right-sided airways with the right middle lobe and right lower lobe orifices displaced to the same level as the right upper lobe. Inspection of the right upper lobe was normal.  The right middle and right lower lobe bronchi were completely obstructed by granulation tissue and debris from previous bronchoscopy yesterday approximately 2 cm distal to orifice. There were small airway tears along the medial aspect of the right lower lobe and lateral aspect of right middle lobe assay where foreign body was extracted yesterday. With saline flushes we were able to bypass the obstruction in both the middle and lower lobe. Excessive debris and granulation tissue were developed with a combination of cryoprobe and flexible forceps however as a result of chronicity of obstruction and inflammation the areas remain mostly obstructed requiring saline flushes to push through the area of obstruction.  Decision was made to place bronchial stents in hopes of reforming native airway orientation and to allow healing of airway tears. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and a thin disposable and the bronchoscope was inserted alongside an Aero 10 x 20 mm covered self-expandable metallic stent which was advanced over the guidewire and positioned within the right lower lobe bronchi and says obstruction based on direct visualization technique..  The stent was deployed however slightly distal. Attempts to retract the stent by grasping the proximal string were unsuccessful and it became obvious that the stent was oversized.  Using rigid forceps we are unable to remove the inappropriately sized stent and using a similar technique placed a 8 x 20 mm arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis.  Subsequently CRE balloon dilatation of the stent was performed and distal airways of the right lower lobe to include the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior segments were widely patent.  The superior segment was partially jailed.  Using a similar technique we then placed a 8 x 15 mm m arrow fully covered self-expanding metallic stent within the area of stenosis. In the right middle lobe.  Attention was taken to ensure that kissing stents did not result in obvious tissue necrosis or external compression of either airway.  The right middle lobe stent was then dilated using a CRE balloon and distal airways were widely patent. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery.
RESULTS: Successful insertion of bronchial stents within the right middle and right lower lobe bronchi resulting in near complete recanalization of previously obstructed airways.
COMPLICATIONS: None
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- To PACU for recovery
- Admit to internal medicine wards overnight
- Initiate airway clearance regimen with nebulized 3% saline (3 mL) mixed with albuterol (2 mL) 3 times a day.
- Obtain post- procedural chest x-ray 
- Plan to return to operating room in 2 weeks for stent removal

INFORMED CONSENT: Extended discussion with patient regarding investigational nature of pulsed field ablation for lung tumors. Patient enrolled in IRB-approved protocol. Detailed explanation of traditional ablation alternatives (microwave, RFA, cryo). Patient elected to participate after reviewing consent documents and meeting with research coordinator.

TECHNIQUE:
General anesthesia. ENB performed with illumiSite platform. Target: LUL apicoposterior segment. Radial EBUS confirmation of lesion. Novel PFA catheter (FarapulsePulm system, 3.0mm diameter, bipolar electrode configuration) advanced through extended working channel. IMPORTANT: PFA uses rapid electrical pulses (1000-2000 V/cm) to create irreversible electroporation of cell membranes WITHOUT thermal damage - fundamentally different mechanism than traditional ablation modalities.

ABLATION PARAMETERS:
- Pulse duration: 100 microseconds
- Number of pulses: 80 per cycle  
- Pulse frequency: 1 Hz
- Number of treatment cycles: 3
- Inter-cycle pause: 30 seconds
- Voltage: 1500 V (adjusted based on impedance 80-120 ohms)
- Energy delivery: Non-thermal (avoids bronchial damage, theoretically preserves adjacent structures)

INTRAPROCEDURAL MONITORING:
Advanced impedance mapping performed throughout treatment showing successful energy delivery to entire tumor volume. Real-time EBUS post-ablation showed immediate increased echogenicity within tumor - consistent with cellular disruption from electroporation. No thermal injury pattern noted on adjacent bronchial walls (major advantage of PFA technology).

OUTCOMES: 
Successfully completed per protocol. No arrhythmias noted (ECG monitoring showed stable rhythm - PFA timed to occur outside cardiac vulnerable period). Patient hemodynamically stable. Airways intact, no hemorrhage.

NOVEL FINDINGS: 
PFA appears to cause more homogeneous ablation zone compared to thermal modalities. Real-time elastography (investigational feature) suggested complete tumor necrosis immediately post-procedure.

DISPOSITION: Research protocol follow-up including CT at 48 hours, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks with volumetric analysis. Patient enrolled in long-term registry (5-year follow-up).

Research coordinator contacted. Data forms completed.

COMPLICATIONS: None

"CASE PRESENTATION: Complex Navigation Bronchoscopy

PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS:
A 64-year-old male (Case ID: C-847, Synthetic Name: Martin Lee, MRN: QQ-8473-R, DOB: 05/22/1960) former smoker with 45 pack-year history presented with an incidentally discovered left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule.

IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS:
Computed tomography demonstrated a 17mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe superior segment without clear bronchus sign. Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.

PROCEDURAL APPROACH:
Given the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.

Sedation Protocol:
Deep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.

Technical Details:
The electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension™) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning identified optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.

The extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.

Radiation Exposure:
Total fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes
Dose-area product: 268 cGy·cm²
(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)

Sampling Protocol:
Following tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:
- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)
- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens
- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples

COMPLICATIONS:
Small apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was identified on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.

QUALITY METRICS:
- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved
- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)
- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete
- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology

DISCUSSION:
This case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"PATIENT: Susan M. O'Brien
MRN: HUP-2025-7734  
DOB: July 4, 1961 (64 years old)
DATE: November 2, 2025
LOCATION: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA
PROCEDURALIST: Dr. Michael Steinberg, MD, FCCP
ASSISTANT: Dr. Rachel Kim, DO (IP Fellow)

INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:
Ms. O'Brien is a delightful 64-year-old former librarian who presents with right middle lobe peripheral nodule discovered on CT performed for evaluation of persistent cough. Initial imaging demonstrated 2.4 cm spiculated nodule in right middle lobe lateral segment with pleural retraction. PET scan showed intense uptake with SUV max 13.4. Navigational bronchoscopy with radial EBUS-guided biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. 

Patient has complicated medical history including chronic kidney disease stage 4 (not on dialysis, baseline creatinine 2.9), chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30%), and severe osteoporosis with multiple compression fractures. Thoracic surgery evaluation determined patient to be extremely high risk for lobectomy with estimated perioperative mortality exceeding 15%. Radiation oncology consulted but patient declined stereotactic body radiation therapy after extensive discussion, preferring bronchoscopic intervention.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
I met with Ms. O'Brien and her husband in the pre-procedure area. We reviewed the nature of the procedure, expected benefits, and potential risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, need for chest tube placement, bronchopleural fistula, and possible need for surgical intervention for complications. We also discussed the possibility that ablation may not completely treat the tumor and that additional therapies might be necessary. Patient and family demonstrated excellent understanding and provided informed consent.

Patient brought to bronchoscopy suite at 0815. Anesthesiology team (Dr. Paul Reynolds attending) present. Standard monitoring established. Given comorbidities and anticipated procedure duration, decision made for general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.

Following induction and intubation with 8.0 ETT, therapeutic bronchoscope advanced revealing normal appearing airway anatomy throughout. No endobronchial lesions, external compressions, or dynamic collapse noted.

Electromagnetic navigation initiated using Medtronic superDimension system with prior CT imaging from 10/20/2025. Planning performed identifying target in RML lateral segment. Registration achieved with 8 reference points yielding registration accuracy of 3.1mm.

Guide sheath (8.0 Fr) navigated to peripheral target location. Due to RML anatomy with somewhat straight trajectory, navigation was relatively straightforward requiring approximately 8 minutes. Radial EBUS performed confirming target lesion in solid contact position. Lesion appeared as heterogeneous hypoechoic mass measuring approximately 24 x 21mm.

Cone-beam CT performed confirming guide sheath position within acceptable range of target (7mm from center). Pleural surface distance measured at 18mm - appropriate safety margin for microwave ablation.

Microwave ablation antenna (Medtronic Emprint system, 15mm active tip) advanced through extended working channel to target center. Pre-ablation checklist completed including: airway clearance verified, antenna position confirmed, impedance check normal (85 ohms), safety zone confirmed without major vessels in immediate ablation field.

Microwave ablation commenced with following parameters:
- Power: 65 watts
- Duration: 6 minutes
- Mode: standard tissue
- Temperature monitoring: peak temperature 92°C at antenna tip

During ablation, patient remained remarkably stable with no hemodynamic changes. No arrhythmias noted. Respiratory mechanics unchanged. 

Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic region replacing previously hypoechoic tumor, consistent with coagulation necrosis. Ablation zone appeared to extend adequately beyond visible tumor margins.

Equipment removed sequentially with careful airway inspection showing:
- Mild erythema at peripheral catheter contact sites
- No ulceration or mucosal disruption  
- No hemorrhage
- Small amount of serous fluid (<5mL)

Remainder of bronchoscopy unremarkable. Patient emerged from anesthesia smoothly. Extubated after meeting standard criteria. Transferred to recovery area with oxygen saturation 93% on room air (baseline similar per chart review).

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal (<5mL)
FLUIDS: 750mL crystalloid  
COMPLICATIONS: None during procedure
SPECIMENS: None sent
DEVICES: Medtronic superDimension navigation, Emprint microwave system

IMPRESSION:
Technically successful bronchoscopic electromagnetic navigation with microwave ablation of right middle lobe peripheral adenocarcinoma in 64-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities precluding surgical resection.

PLAN GOING FORWARD:
Patient admitted to pulmonary step-down unit for monitoring. Initial portable chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax. CT chest with contrast performed this evening showed appropriate ablation zone without immediate complications. Patient doing well with minimal pain (3/10) controlled with oral acetaminophen. Planning discharge tomorrow with:

- Close outpatient follow-up in 1 week with repeat chest X-ray
- CT chest at 6-8 weeks for initial response assessment (expecting to see decrease in size of ablation zone with central low attenuation)  
- PET-CT in 3 months to assess metabolic response (successful ablation should show minimal or no FDG uptake)
- Long-term surveillance CT every 3 months for first year, then every 6 months

Patient counseled extensively on post-ablation syndrome (fever, flu-like symptoms possible for 3-5 days - normal inflammatory response). Instructed on warning signs for complications. Patient and husband expressed gratitude and understanding of plan.

The lesion demonstrated a positive bronchus sign and had a standardized uptake value of five point two on positron emission tomography imaging suggesting malignancy. She underwent moderate conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam three milligrams and fentanyl one hundred micrograms achieving a Ramsay sedation score of three. Her blood pressure was monitored at ten minute intervals throughout and remained stable in the one twenties to one thirties over seventies to eighties. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored and stayed above ninety-five percent on room air.

The EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the oral route. 5cc of 2% lidocaine was instilled for topical anesthesia. Initial airway inspection was unremarkable.
Station 4R (Right paratracheal):

Size: 24mm (short axis)
Echo Features: Heterogeneous, irregular borders, comet-tail artifacts suggestive of calcification
PET SUV: 8.5

Initial TBNA with 21G needle was performed (3 passes). ROSE showed predominantly inflammatory cells with necrotic debris, non-diagnostic.
Intranodal Forceps Biopsy Technique:
The EBUS 21G needle was used to create a tract through the bronchial wall and nodal capsule under real-time ultrasound guidance. The needle was removed and 1.1mm mini-forceps were advanced through the established tract into the lymph node under ultrasound visualization. The forceps jaws were opened and visible ultrasound artifact confirmed intra-nodal position. Four core samples were obtained with visible tissue in forceps each time.
ROSE on forceps specimens: Adequate cellularity with necrotizing granulomas and multinucleated giant cells, consistent with granulomatous inflammation.
Station 7 (Subcarinal):

Size: 18mm (short axis)
Echo Features: Similar to 4R with heterogeneous pattern
PET SUV: 7.2

Similar intranodal forceps biopsy technique performed with 3 core samples obtained. ROSE: Granulomatous inflammation.
Hemostasis was adequate after each sampling with no immediate complications. Final inspection showed no bleeding.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. The attending, Dr. Murphy, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S):

Station 4R: TBNA x3 (cytology), IFB x4 (histology, AFB/fungal culture)
Station 7: IFB x3 (histology, AFB/fungal culture)

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Anderson underwent successful EBUS with intranodal forceps biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes. Preliminary cytology shows necrotizing granulomatous inflammation.

"Patient Name: Michael Thompson
MRN: 7294163
Date of Procedure: March 1, 2021

Preoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction
Postoperative Diagnosis: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y-stent placement

Surgeon: Jennifer Williams, MD
Indications: Airway obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient's family acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation), we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and had to convert to a 12 mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately, due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening, two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.

Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstems with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patent. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent. It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue with only mild extrinsic compression.

Tumor debulking was performed using APC to ""burn and shave"" the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.

Once we were able to bypass the central tumor, the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1 cm past the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left-sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement was also limited to the first cm past the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, but the right-sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.

After measuring the airways, we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65 mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 40 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid, and using Freitag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb, we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were eventually able to seat the stent into proper position. Post-insertion, the trachea, right mainstem, and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope and turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.

Recommendations:
- Transfer back to ICU
- Post-procedure x-ray
- Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance
- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge
- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction. Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

Procedures:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (Illumisite platform) with cone-beam CT guidance in a hybrid OR.
2. Radial EBUS confirmation of peripheral lesion position.
3. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right lower lobe nodule using Emprint catheter.

Description: After induction and intubation, a therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced to the right lower lobe. The planning CT was registered on the Illumisite platform; a pathway was generated to the posterior basal segment nodule. Following peripheral navigation, digital tomosynthesis corrected CT-to-body divergence and demonstrated a bullseye view of the lesion. A CrossCountry needle was advanced into the lesion, and an extended working channel (EWC) was positioned 1 cm beyond the nodule center. Radial EBUS showed a concentric hypoechoic lesion. An Emprint microwave catheter was advanced until the ablation center was aligned with the lesion. A single 10-minute ablation using the standard lung protocol was delivered. Post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated a concentric ground-glass ablation zone with a minimal circumferential margin of approximately 6 mm. There was no significant airway bleeding and the segmental bronchi remained patent.

"OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE
PART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)
Patient brought to hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:

Correct patient (ID band, verbal confirmation)
Procedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)
Positioning (supine throughout)
Antibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)
Steroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)
Blood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)

Initial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.
Initial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:
Olympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:

Supraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions
Vocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses
Subglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis
Trachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions
Carina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy
Left main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter
LUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent
Right main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.

Decision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.
Rigid Bronchoscopy Phase:
Patient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.
Ventilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.
The rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.
Mechanical Debridement:
Using the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.
Estimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue
Hemostasis Measures:
As expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:

Iced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.
Topical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.
Tranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.

After approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.
Electrocautery:
Flexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.
Treatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus
Treatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time
Effect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis
Argon Plasma Coagulation:
APC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.
Treatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.
Duration: 6 minutes active APC time
Result: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface
Assessment after debridement:
Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.
Balloon Dilation:
Boston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.
Inflation sequence:

First inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Second inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds
Third inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)

Fluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.
Post-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.
Stent Placement:
After discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.
Stent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length
Deployment technique:

Stent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance
Positioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus
Fluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views
Slow, controlled deployment under direct visualization
Post-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion

Post-stent assessment:
Flexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.
Findings:

Stent well-positioned, no migration
Excellent apposition to airway walls
RUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent
RML orifice: Visible and patent
RLL orifice: Visible and patent
All segments of right lung now visualized for first time
Significant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)

Therapeutic Aspiration:
Extensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:

Right upper lobe: Approximately 30mL
Right middle lobe: Approximately 20mL
Right lower lobe: Approximately 40mL

Total secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.
Final Airway Inspection:

Trachea: Normal
Left bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent
Right main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)
RUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation
Minimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent

Rigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).

Estimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL
Specimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)

PART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)
Patient repositioned with arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.
TEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.
Surgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):

Subxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm
Dissection carried down to pericardium
Pericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created
Rush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid
Pericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)
No active bleeding from pericardial surface
19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space
Drain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction

TEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.

PART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)
With patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.
Ultrasound examination (performed by IP team):

Right hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion
Estimated volume: 1000-1200mL
Anechoic fluid, no loculations
Compressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)

PleurX catheter placement:
Standard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Exit site: 5cm anterior. Catheter advanced 15cm into pleural space.
Initial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).

POSTOPERATIVE DISPOSITION & PLAN
Immediate (ICU):

Extubate when fully awake and following commands (anticipated within 2-4 hours)
Chest X-ray immediately post-procedure and daily x3 days
Monitor pericardial drain output
Pleural catheter to drain q3 days initially
Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (started on Pip-Tazo for post-obstructive pneumonia)
DVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ
PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometry

Short-term (Inpatient, 3-5 days):

Remove pericardial drain when output <50mL/day
Transition to floor when stable
Continue PleurX catheter drainage
Pain control
Physical therapy for reconditioning

Medium-term (1-2 weeks):

Discharge with home health for PleurX catheter management
Follow-up in IP clinic at 2 weeks with chest X-ray
Discuss with oncology regarding re-initiation of systemic therapy now that dyspnea improved

Long-term:

Surveillance bronchoscopy at 6-8 weeks to assess stent
Monitor for stent-related complications (migration, granulation, tumor in-growth)
May need stent revision/exchange
PleurX catheter to remain until auto-pleurodesis occurs or end of life


ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
Mrs. Okafor presented with critical, multi-system involvement of metastatic lung cancer causing:

Near-complete right mainstem bronchus obstruction → Successfully addressed with tumor debridement and stent
Cardiac tamponade physiology → Successfully addressed with pericardial window
Large pleural effusion → Successfully palliated with PleurX catheter

All procedures were technically successful without intra-operative complications. The patient now has:

Restored right lung ventilation (dramatic improvement from pre-procedure state)
Resolution of cardiac compromise
Control of pleural effusion

Prognosis: Given stage IV disease, prognosis remains guarded with likely survival measured in months. However, these palliative interventions should significantly improve quality of life by reducing dyspnea and allowing potential resumption of systemic therapy.
The patient and family understand this is palliative care aimed at symptom control rather than cure. They expressed gratitude for the interventions and understanding of the goals of care.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT
I, David Kim, MD, was present and actively participating throughout the entire procedure. I performed the critical portions of the airway intervention including tumor debridement, cautery, stent placement, and final bronchoscopic assessment. I supervised Dr. Foster throughout the pleural catheter placement. I assisted the cardiothoracic surgery team during pericardial window creation.
The procedure was medically necessary, technically indicated, and appropriately performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.

**CONSULT QUESTION:**
""Patient with known metastatic breast cancer, now with new RLL nodule. Concern for lung metastasis vs new primary. Please evaluate and biopsy if appropriate. Also noted to have enlarged subcarinal node.""

**HISTORY:**
74F with PMH of Stage II ER+/HER2- invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnosed 2017, treated with lumpectomy + radiation + endocrine therapy. Developed bone and liver metastases 2023, currently on palbociclib + letrozole with stable disease.

Recent surveillance CT shows new 2.8cm RLL nodule (not present on prior CT 6 months ago). Also new subcarinal lymphadenopathy 2.1cm. PET/CT: RLL nodule SUV 6.4, subcarinal node SUV 5.9.

Clinical question: Progression of breast cancer to lung vs. new primary lung cancer (would change management significantly).

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Combined EBUS-TBNA + EMN bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis with appropriate immunohistochemistry to differentiate breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.

Patient agreeable, scheduled for procedure same day given oncologic urgency.
**PROCEDURE PERFORMED:**

**EBUS-TBNA + EMN Bronchoscopy + Transbronchial Biopsy**

"PATIENT: Robert Johnson, 67-year-old Male
MRN: 3692014
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Mr. Johnson is a 67-year-old male with a 2.8cm spiculated right lower lobe nodule discovered on screening CT. PET-avid with SUV 4.5. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to navigational bronchoscopy with cryobiopsy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (CPT 31627), Radial EBUS (CPT 31654), Transbronchial Cryobiopsy (CPT 31632), Endobronchial Blocker Placement
ATTENDING: Dr. Patricia Williams
ASSISTANT: Dr. David Lee, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Jessica Brown
RT: Anthony Garcia

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring
INSTRUMENT: SuperDimension Navigation System, Olympus BF-1TH190 bronchoscope, 1.9mm cryoprobe, 7Fr Arndt endobronchial blocker
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 30 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia and intubation with 8.0 ETT, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
Ventilation Parameters:

Mode: Volume Control
RR: 12
TV: 500mL
PEEP: 5 cmH2O
FiO2: 40%
Flow Rate: 50 L/min
Pmean: 15 cmH2O

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was performed using the SuperDimension system. CT scan from 9/10/2024 was loaded onto the planning station to generate 3D rendering. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified, then loaded into the navigation platform.
EMN Registration: Automatic registration was used. Adequate airway landmark matching achieved at carina, right main carina, and RLL subsegmental bifurcations. Mean fiducial error: 4.2mm. Global alignment quality: excellent.
The EMN catheter was advanced under navigational guidance to the target lesion in the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (RB9). Target lesion measured 2.8cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to 0.8cm from the planned target.
Radial EBUS Survey: Performed to confirm nodule location. The following features were noted: Concentric pattern, heterogeneous echogenicity, lesion size 27mm, no large vessels visualized in the biopsy path.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsy: After confirming absence of significant vessels at the biopsy site with radial EBUS, transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed using a 1.9mm cryoprobe. Freeze-thaw cycle: 6 seconds freeze, passive thaw. After each sample was obtained, the Arndt endobronchial blocker was positioned at the RLL ostium and inflated with 6cc of air for hemostasis. Total 4 samples were collected.
After each biopsy, the blocker was maintained for 2 minutes, then deflated. Inspection showed minimal bleeding, which resolved spontaneously. Final inspection showed patent airways with no active bleeding.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Williams, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S):

RLL cryobiopsy x4 (histology)
Additional tissue for molecular testing

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Mr. Johnson underwent successful navigational bronchoscopy with cryobiopsy of RLL nodule. Preliminary frozen section showed atypical cells, final pathology pending.

"PATIENT NAME: Rodriguez, Maria G.
MEDICAL RECORD NUMBER: 2025-IP-9847
DATE OF BIRTH: 03/08/1955 (Age 70 years)
PROCEDURE DATE: October 15, 2025
INSTITUTION: Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Kevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP
FELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)
ANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on 09/22/2025 yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative

OPERATION PERFORMED:
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule

CLINICAL SCENARIO:
Patient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. 

General anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. 

Olympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:
- Normal supraglottic structures
- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia
- Carina: sharp, mobile
- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy
- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from 10/05/2025 with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment identified at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.

Registration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). 

Steerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.

Radial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.

Fluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).

Cryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:

Cycle 1: 
- Freeze time: 6 minutes
- Temperature at probe tip: -165°C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)
- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20°C)

Cycle 2:
- Freeze time: 6 minutes  
- Temperature: -167°C
- Passive thaw: 4 minutes

Cycle 3:
- Freeze time: 5 minutes
- Temperature: -163°C
- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)

Throughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.

Post-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.

Cryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:
- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)
- No hemorrhage
- No airway perforation
- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)

Complete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. 

Bronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.

FINDINGS:
1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target
2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)
3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS
4. No procedural complications

SPECIMENS: None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL

INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution

COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively

DRAINS/TUBES: None placed

POST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:
1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring
2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications
4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging
5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain
6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)
7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen
8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake
9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated
10. Diet as tolerated
11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course
- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray
- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)
- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation
- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually

DISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:
Extensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.

**URGENT CASE - POST-BIOPSY HEMORRHAGE MANAGEMENT**

ORIGINAL PROCEDURE: Transthoracic needle biopsy RUL nodule by interventional radiology (performed 11/07/2025, 1430hrs). Biopsy complicated by significant hemorrhage with hemothorax development requiring chest tube placement. Patient transferred to ICU overnight. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.

MODIFIED INDICATION: 
Given active bleeding from biopsy site and confirmed malignancy, multidisciplinary discussion between interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Decision made for bronchoscopic approach to: (1) achieve hemostasis and (2) treat tumor definitively with ablation given high surgical risk and desire to avoid repeat intervention.

**EMERGENT BRONCHOSCOPY WITH RFA - MODIFIED PROTOCOL**

Patient still with chest tube in place (right pigtail, 14Fr). Active output decreased but persistent blood-tinged drainage 50mL/hr. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2 after transfusion.

PROCEDURE (Performed 11/08/2025, 0800hrs):
General anesthesia, intubation. Bronchoscopy showed blood in RUL but no active endobronchial source. ENB navigation to RUL posterior segment biopsy site/tumor location. Immediate goal: hemostasis. Secondary goal: tumor ablation.

RFA probe (VIVANT, 1.5cm tip) placed at hemorrhage site within tumor. Treatment modified from standard protocol:
- Initial lower power (40W x 3min) for cauterization/hemostasis
- Then standard ablation (90°C x 8min) for tumor treatment
- Careful monitoring for increased bleeding during treatment

OUTCOME: 
Successfully achieved hemostasis - no further bleeding noted post-ablation. Tumor ablation completed per protocol. Chest tube output decreased to <10mL/hr serosanguinous fluid immediately post-procedure.

COMPLICATIONS: None additional

MODIFIED PLAN:
- ICU monitoring continues
- Chest tube remains, anticipate removal tomorrow if output <50mL/24hr
- CT chest at 48hr  
- Standard post-ablation follow-up once acute issues resolved

**UNUSUAL CASE DISCUSSION:**
This represents off-label use of bronchoscopic RFA for both hemostasis and tumor treatment following complicated transthoracic biopsy. While not standard indication, multidisciplinary team felt this was best approach to manage both bleeding and provide definitive treatment in one procedure. Case to be presented at morbidity/mortality conference for systems review of management pathway.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Bronchoscopic electromagnetic navigation with microwave ablation of right upper lobe peripheral nodule

INDICATION:
67-year-old gentleman with 45 pack-year smoking history presents with incidentally discovered 2.3 cm spiculated nodule in right upper lobe posterior segment. PET-CT demonstrates SUV max 8.4. Transthoracic needle biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Patient evaluated by thoracic surgery but deemed prohibitive surgical risk. Multidisciplinary tumor board recommended bronchoscopic ablation vs SBRT. Patient elected for bronchoscopic microwave ablation after extensive discussion of risks and benefits.

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
After informed consent, patient brought to interventional pulmonology suite. Time-out performed. General anesthesia induced with propofol and rocuronium, patient intubated with 8.5 ETT.

ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Robert Chang, MD, MBA

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule, segment RB9, measuring 2.7 x 2.4 cm on most recent CT imaging dated 09/15/2025, with associated spiculation and pleural tethering highly concerning for malignancy. Previous transthoracic needle biopsy performed on 08/30/2025 yielded diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 positive, confirming primary lung origin.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: As above

PROCEDURE(S) PERFORMED:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy with complete airway survey
2. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with real-time cone-beam CT guidance
3. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe confirmation of target lesion
4. Radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe peripheral nodule
5. Post-procedural bronchoscopic assessment

CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:
This is a very pleasant 73-year-old retired teacher with significant past medical history including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD Stage III, FEV1 34% predicted), pulmonary hypertension (mean PA pressure 42 mmHg on recent right heart catheterization), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) who was found to have right lower lobe nodule on routine surveillance imaging. Patient has extensive 60 pack-year tobacco history, quit 3 years ago. After thorough workup including PET-CT showing SUV max 9.7 and transthoracic needle biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma, patient presented to multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. Given prohibitive surgical risk with predicted postoperative mortality >20% by thoracic surgery risk calculator, and patient preference to avoid radiation therapy, decision made to proceed with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation as definitive treatment modality.

DETAILED PROCEDURAL DESCRIPTION:
Following standard institutional time-out procedure and verification of correct patient, procedure, and laterality, the patient was brought to the advanced bronchoscopy suite (Suite 4) in the interventional pulmonology procedural area. Anesthesiology team performed standard ASA monitors placement. Given anticipated procedural duration >60 minutes and need for complete immobility during ablation, decision made to proceed with general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation.

Anesthesia was induced using propofol 150 mg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rocuronium 50 mg administered to facilitate intubation. Direct laryngoscopy performed and 8.5mm internal diameter endotracheal tube placed atraumatically with good bilateral breath sounds confirmed. Tube secured at 23 cm at the teeth. Patient maintained on sevoflurane 1.5-2% for maintenance of general anesthesia throughout procedure.

Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope (model BF-1TH190) advanced through endotracheal tube adapter. Systematic survey of airways performed documenting: normal appearing vocal cords, patent trachea without lesions or external compression, normal carina with sharp angle bilaterally, normal appearing right and left mainstem bronchi. Detailed inspection of right lower lobe bronchial tree including superior segment and all basal segments revealed no endobronchial abnormalities, no external compression, and patent airways throughout.

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy initiated using Veran SPiN Thoracic Navigation System. Pre-procedure thin-slice CT imaging (1mm cuts) from 09/20/2025 loaded into planning software. Target lesion in right lower lobe lateral basal segment (RB9) identified and navigation pathway planned. After registration using automatic registration mode with 8 reference points, registration accuracy calculated at 3.2 mm, which is excellent and well within acceptable parameters.

Navigation performed using 8Fr steerable guide catheter (Always-On Tip Tracked) advanced through working channel. Multiple adjustments and catheter manipulations required due to acute angle into RB9. After approximately 12 minutes of careful navigation, guide sheath successfully positioned at target site. Position confirmed with radial endobronchial ultrasound probe (20 MHz) showing target lesion in direct contact position with characteristic hypoechoic solid mass appearance. Internal architecture showed heterogeneous echotexture consistent with malignancy. Lesion measured approximately 24 mm x 22 mm on real-time EBUS.

Cone-beam CT performed (Siemens Artis Pheno with DynaCT Needle Guidance software) confirming guide sheath position within 8mm of geometric center of target nodule. Distance from pleura measured at 15mm. After review of cone-beam images and confirmation of safe ablation zone without critical vessels, decision made to proceed.

Extended working channel (EWC, 2.0mm diameter) passed through guide sheath. Radiofrequency ablation probe (VIVANT MEDICAL systems, 1.5cm active tip, single electrode configuration) advanced through EWC under direct visualization. Probe position confirmed at lesion center with repeat radial EBUS showing probe centrally located within target.

Radiofrequency ablation protocol initiated per institutional guidelines for lesions 2-3cm. Settings: impedance-controlled algorithm, target temperature 90°C, duration 8 minutes for initial ablation cycle. Real-time impedance monitoring demonstrated initial reading of 85 ohms with gradual rise during treatment. Temperature monitoring at probe tip showed appropriate heating curve reaching target temperature within 90 seconds. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout ablation with vital signs: HR 72-85, BP 132/78 - 145/82, SpO2 98-100% on FiO2 0.6. End-tidal CO2 maintained 35-38 mmHg.

After completion of initial 8-minute cycle, probe repositioned 5mm posterior to treat overlapping zone and ensure complete ablation coverage of entire tumor volume plus 5mm margin. Second ablation cycle performed: 6 minutes, target temperature 90°C. Impedance monitoring again demonstrated appropriate curve. Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic changes throughout entire tumor volume consistent with coagulative necrosis. Ice-cream cone appearance of ablation zone well visualized extending beyond original tumor margins.

Guide sheath and EWC slowly withdrawn under direct bronchoscopic visualization. Careful inspection of airways performed showing mild mucosal hyperemia at catheter contact points but no evidence of perforation, significant edema, or active hemorrhage. Small amount of serosanguinous secretions suctioned from right lower lobe, estimated <10 mL total.

Airways irrigated with normal saline. Bronchoscope withdrawn and patient emerged from general anesthesia without complications. Following standard reversal and spontaneous ventilation recovery, patient successfully extubated with good cough and gag reflexes. Transferred to post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition with oxygen saturation 94% on 2L NC.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal, less than 15 milliliters
INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS ADMINISTERED: 1000 mL lactated Ringer's solution
SPECIMENS SENT: None
COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively

FINDINGS:
1. Successful electromagnetic navigation to RLL lateral basal segment target lesion
2. Radiofrequency ablation completed per protocol with two overlapping ablation zones
3. Good real-time monitoring throughout with appropriate impedance and temperature curves
4. Post-ablation imaging demonstrates adequate treatment zone with apparent complete coverage
5. No immediate procedural complications identified

ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
74-year-old gentleman with biopsy-proven RLL peripheral adenocarcinoma, poor surgical candidate, status post successful bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation. Procedure technically successful with good positioning and ablation parameters. Patient tolerated procedure well without complications.

PLAN:
1. Admit to Pulmonary Intermediate Care Unit (7 East) for overnight observation
2. Continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry monitoring overnight
3. Chest radiograph in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax or other acute complications
4. CT chest with intravenous contrast in 24 hours to assess ablation zone and rule out complications
5. Pain management: scheduled acetaminophen 1000mg q8h, oxycodone 5mg q6h PRN moderate pain, hydromorphone 0.5mg IV q4h PRN severe pain
6. Aggressive pulmonary toilet: incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake, chest physiotherapy as needed
7. Empiric antibiotics NOT indicated at this time given low infection risk
8. Anticipated discharge tomorrow if overnight course uncomplicated and CT scan reassuring
9. Follow-up arrangements: Clinic visit in 1 week with CXR, CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment, PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response
10. Continue home medications including COPD regimen, cardiac medications
11. Patient and family extensively counseled on post-procedure expectations, warning signs for complications (increasing dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis), importance of follow-up

I have personally performed and supervised this entire procedure. All findings, interventions, and recommendations above represent my direct involvement and assessment.

"PATIENT: Linda Chen, 72-year-old Female
MRN: 4783621
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Ms. Chen is a 72-year-old female with known squamous cell lung cancer presenting with worsening dyspnea and stridor. CT chest shows near-complete obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus by endobronchial tumor. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to therapeutic bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left mainstem bronchus obstruction secondary to endobronchial tumor
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Rigid Bronchoscopy, Endobronchial Tumor Destruction (CPT 31641), Mechanical Tumor Debridement (CPT 31640), Airway Stent Placement (CPT 31631)
ATTENDING: Dr. Michael Anderson
ASSISTANT: Dr. Sarah Kim, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Robert Martinez
RT: Lisa Johnson
Anesthesia: Dr. Thomas Wright

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line
INSTRUMENT: Storz rigid bronchoscope (14mm), Olympus flexible bronchoscope, Electrocautery (Bovie), APC probe, mechanical debrider, 14mm x 60mm silicone stent (Dumon)
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll
A rigid bronchoscope (14mm) was introduced via the mouth under direct visualization. High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) was utilized. A complete airway survey was performed.
Initial Findings:

Trachea: Patent, no lesions
Right mainstem: Patent, mucosa normal
Left mainstem: 90% obstructed by friable, hemorrhagic endobronchial tumor starting 1cm distal to the carina and extending 3cm distally

Therapeutic Interventions:
1. Mechanical Debridement: The tumor was cored using the rigid bronchoscope with mechanical debridement. Multiple passes were required to remove bulk tumor. Estimated tumor volume removed: 15cc.
2. Electrocautery: Residual tumor base was treated with electrocautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. Total treatment time: 3 minutes. FiO2 maintained at 40% during cautery.
3. Argon Plasma Coagulation: APC was applied to residual tumor at 40 watts, argon flow 1.5 L/min. Treatment applied circumferentially to tumor base. Duration: 2 minutes.
Results: Prior to treatment, left mainstem bronchus was 10% patent. After treatment, the airway was 70% patent.
4. Stent Placement: Due to significant malacia and risk of re-obstruction, a 14mm x 60mm Dumon silicone stent was deployed in the left mainstem bronchus under direct visualization and fluoroscopic guidance. Stent position confirmed endoscopically with good apposition to airway wall.
Hemostasis was confirmed with minimal oozing controlled with topical epinephrine (1:10,000 dilution, 10mL instilled). A flexible bronchoscope was passed through the rigid barrel for final inspection showing:

Patent stent lumen
Visible LUL and LLL orifices through stent
No significant bleeding

The bronchoscope and adjunct instruments were withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
SPECIMEN(S):

Endobronchial tumor debridement (histology)

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Chen is a 72-year-old female with squamous cell lung cancer and critical left mainstem obstruction. Successful therapeutic bronchoscopy with tumor debridement, cautery, APC, and stent placement. Airway patency improved from 10% to 70%. Patient will require surveillance bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks.

- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 11L:** 18mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 3 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Assessment after EBUS:** Extensive N2/N3 disease. Primary still needs biopsy for confirmation.

**PART 2: AIRWAY INSPECTION**

EBUS scope removed. Standard bronchoscope inserted.

**Finding:** LLL orifice shows endobronchial tumor - exophytic mass nearly occluding orifice, friable appearance.

**Decision:** Obtain endobronchial biopsies directly (easier/safer than navigating to peripheral component).

**Endobronchial biopsies:** 6 specimens obtained from visible LLL tumor using standard forceps.

Moderate bleeding from biopsy site. Managed with:
- Wedging bronchoscope
- Epinephrine 1:10,000, 5mL instilled
- Held position x 2 minutes
- Bleeding resolved

**ROSE (endobronchial):** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples""

SuperDimension EMN system used. CT from 03/05/2025 loaded.

**Registration:** Auto-registration, 7 points, adequate accuracy.

**Navigation:** Attempted to navigate to LLL superior segment (peripheral component of mass). However, significant tumor in proximal airway made navigation difficult. Guide advanced as far as possible but unable to reach planned target (remained ~15mm away per system).

**Radial EBUS:** Probe advanced through guide - visualized mass with eccentric pattern but adequate for sampling.

**Peripheral sampling:**
- Forceps biopsies x 5
- Brushings x 2

**ROSE:** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - adequate for molecular testing""

**ROSE Checkpoint (Dr. Kim):**
""Adequate cellularity. Atypical glandular epithelial cells. Favor adenocarcinoma, morphologically similar to 4R lymph node. Recommend obtaining larger tissue sample for molecular testing - cryobiopsy suggested.""

**Cryobiopsy Procedure:**

Given ROSE findings and need for comprehensive molecular testing, cryobiopsy performed for larger tissue cores.

Preparation:
- Arndt endobronchial blocker (7Fr) placed in RUL ostium under direct visualization

- Sample gently thawed in saline
- Placed in formalin
- Gross inspection: Excellent tissue core, ~8mm length

**Repeat cryobiopsy:**
- Second sample obtained using same technique
- Blocker inflated between samples x 45 seconds

**Hemostasis Management:**

After cryobiopsies, airways re-inspected:
- Mild oozing from biopsy site in RUL posterior segment
- Managed with:
  * Wedging bronchoscope in segment
  * Iced saline lavage 20cc
  * Gentle suctioning
  * Blocker re-inflated x 60 seconds
  * Complete hemostasis achieved

**Final airway inspection:**
- No active bleeding

**FINDINGS SUMMARY:**

**Based on Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**

**Primary Tumor:**
- Left lower lobe mass: ADENOCARCINOMA confirmed

**Lymph Node Staging:**
- Station 5 (Aortopulmonary window - contralateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N3 disease)
- Station 7 (Subcarinal - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N2 disease)
- Station 10L (Left hilar - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N1 disease)

**Preliminary Staging:**
- Primary tumor (T): T2b (3.6 cm)
- Regional lymph nodes (N): N3 (contralateral mediastinal node involvement)
- Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastases identified on PET/CT)
- **Overall Stage: IIIB (T2bN3M0)**

This represents locally advanced disease with contralateral mediastinal lymph node involvement.
**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT & DISCUSSION:**

**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIB Adenocarcinoma of the Left Lower Lobe

**Significance:**
- This is locally advanced lung cancer with extensive nodal involvement
- N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal node) makes this unresectable by surgical standards
- Patient is NOT a surgical candidate given extent of nodal disease
- Will require systemic therapy +/- radiation

**Prognostic Factors - FAVORABLE:**
- Former smoker (quit 8 years ago) - intermediate prognosis
- Good performance status (ECOG 1)
- Age 61 - relatively young
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (better prognosis than squamous, more treatment options)

**Prognostic Factors - UNFAVORABLE:**
- Stage IIIB with N3 disease
- Large primary tumor (3.6 cm)
- Multilevel nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3)

**Treatment Implications:**
- Primary treatment: Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy (PACIFIC trial paradigm)
- Alternative: Sequential chemotherapy → radiation, or clinical trial
- Role of radiation: Definitive radiation therapy to primary + involved nodal stations
- Surgical resection: Not indicated given N3 disease
- Molecular testing results will be CRITICAL:
  - If EGFR/ALK/ROS1 positive: Consider targeted therapy incorporation
  - PD-L1 status: Guides immunotherapy selection
  - Other actionable mutations: May have clinical trial options

**Awaiting:**
- Final histopathology confirmation (2-3 business days)
- Comprehensive molecular testing (7-14 days, expedite if possible)
- Formal staging completion (see below)
**PLAN & FOLLOW-UP:**

**1. Staging Completion:**
- **Brain MRI with contrast** - Order STAT (high priority in adenocarcinoma, screen for brain metastases which would upstage to Stage IV)
- Review PET/CT from 04/02/2025:
  - Confirm adequate coverage of chest/abdomen/pelvis
  - No suspicious distant lesions
  - If any concerning findings, consider dedicated imaging
- Consider bone scan if bone pain or elevated alkaline phosphatase (though PET usually adequate)

**2. Pathology & Molecular Testing:**
- Monitor for final pathology report (should be available 04/18 or 04/19)
- **EXPEDITE molecular testing** - contact pathology to prioritize
  - EGFR, ALK, ROS1 (highest priority)
  - PD-L1 (critical for immunotherapy decisions)
  - Broader NGS panel
- Call patient with preliminary results once available

**3. Multidisciplinary Tumor Board:**
- **Present case at Thoracic Oncology Tumor Board** - Next meeting 04/23/2025

"Patient: Emily Richardson
MRN: 5183947
Date: April 8, 2022

Preoperative Diagnosis: Respiratory failure secondary to extrinsic tracheal compression
Postoperative Diagnosis: Extrinsic tracheal compression s/p airway stent placement
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy, Silicone Y-stent placement, bronchoscopic intubation

Surgeon: Laura Bennett, MD
Indications: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient's family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated, a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea, inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction (at maximum) of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction extending to approximately 2 cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor.

We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization, the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.

After measuring the airways, we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75 mm in the tracheal limb, 15 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 30 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.

At this point, inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway, the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete.

Post-procedure Diagnosis: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent

Recommendations:
• Transfer to ICU
• Obtain post-procedure CXR
• TID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent

Attending: Russell J. Miller, MD
Anesthesia: General Anesthesia
Monitoring: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

Instrument:
• Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
• Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

Estimated Blood Loss: Minimum
Complications: None

Procedure in Detail:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform. Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.

Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.

Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.

Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.

Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

Specimen(s):
• TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture
• Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture
• BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology

Impression/Plan: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

Recommendations:
• Transfer to PACU
• Obtain chest X-ray
• Discharge home once cleared by PACU
• Await pathology and culture results and based on findings follow up for EBV insertion for COPD

SURGEON: Jessica Muller, MD 
Assistant: Jeffery Tran MD (fellow)
INDICATIONS:  Airway stent partial obstruction from granulation tissue
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. The patient’s Y stent was well placed.  There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60%   after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty and was fully intact.  Once his stent was removed the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted for repeat airway inspection. There was significant (near complete dynamic airway collapse of the trachea and mainstem bronchi as expected given known TBM.  The 1.9mm flexible cryoprobe was inserted through the working channel and cryotherapy was performed in the areas of granulation tissue with 30 second freeze thaw times and at least 3 activations per site. At this point the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Complications: None
Recommendations:
- Transfer back to PACU and then to wards
-  Plan for stent holiday to allow healing of granulation tissue and based on symptoms possible replacement of the stent sometime in the future.

MRN: HUP-2025-7734  
DOB: July 4, 1961 (64 years old)
DATE: November 2, 2025
LOCATION: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA
PROCEDURALIST: Dr. Michael Steinberg, MD, FCCP
ASSISTANT: Dr. Rachel Kim, DO (IP Fellow)

INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:
Ms. O'Brien is a delightful 64-year-old former librarian who presents with right middle lobe peripheral nodule discovered on CT performed for evaluation of persistent cough. Initial imaging demonstrated 2.4 cm spiculated nodule in right middle lobe lateral segment with pleural retraction. PET scan showed intense uptake with SUV max 13.4. Navigational bronchoscopy with radial EBUS-guided biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. 

Patient has complicated medical history including chronic kidney disease stage 4 (not on dialysis, baseline creatinine 2.9), chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30%), and severe osteoporosis with multiple compression fractures. Thoracic surgery evaluation determined patient to be extremely high risk for lobectomy with estimated perioperative mortality exceeding 15%. Radiation oncology consulted but patient declined stereotactic body radiation therapy after extensive discussion, preferring bronchoscopic intervention.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
I met with Ms. O'Brien and her husband in the pre-procedure area. We reviewed the nature of the procedure, expected benefits, and potential risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, need for chest tube placement, bronchopleural fistula, and possible need for surgical intervention for complications. We also discussed the possibility that ablation may not completely treat the tumor and that additional therapies might be necessary. Patient and family demonstrated excellent understanding and provided informed consent.

Patient brought to bronchoscopy suite at 0815. Anesthesiology team (Dr. Paul Reynolds attending) present. Standard monitoring established. Given comorbidities and anticipated procedure duration, decision made for general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.

Following induction and intubation with 8.0 ETT, therapeutic bronchoscope advanced revealing normal appearing airway anatomy throughout. No endobronchial lesions, external compressions, or dynamic collapse noted.

Electromagnetic navigation initiated using Medtronic superDimension system with prior CT imaging from 10/20/2025. Planning performed identifying target in RML lateral segment. Registration achieved with 8 reference points yielding registration accuracy of 3.1mm.

Guide sheath (8.0 Fr) navigated to peripheral target location. Due to RML anatomy with somewhat straight trajectory, navigation was relatively straightforward requiring approximately 8 minutes. Radial EBUS performed confirming target lesion in solid contact position. Lesion appeared as heterogeneous hypoechoic mass measuring approximately 24 x 21mm.

Cone-beam CT performed confirming guide sheath position within acceptable range of target (7mm from center). Pleural surface distance measured at 18mm - appropriate safety margin for microwave ablation.

Microwave ablation antenna (Medtronic Emprint system, 15mm active tip) advanced through extended working channel to target center. Pre-ablation checklist completed including: airway clearance verified, antenna position confirmed, impedance check normal (85 ohms), safety zone confirmed without major vessels in immediate ablation field.

Microwave ablation commenced with following parameters:
- Power: 65 watts
- Duration: 6 minutes
- Mode: standard tissue
- Temperature monitoring: peak temperature 92°C at antenna tip

During ablation, patient remained remarkably stable with no hemodynamic changes. No arrhythmias noted. Respiratory mechanics unchanged. 

Post-ablation radial EBUS performed showing hyperechoic region replacing previously hypoechoic tumor, consistent with coagulation necrosis. Ablation zone appeared to extend adequately beyond visible tumor margins.

Equipment removed sequentially with careful airway inspection showing:
- Mild erythema at peripheral catheter contact sites
- No ulceration or mucosal disruption  
- No hemorrhage
- Small amount of serous fluid (<5mL)

Remainder of bronchoscopy unremarkable. Patient emerged from anesthesia smoothly. Extubated after meeting standard criteria. Transferred to recovery area with oxygen saturation 93% on room air (baseline similar per chart review).

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal (<5mL)
FLUIDS: 750mL crystalloid  
COMPLICATIONS: None during procedure
SPECIMENS: None sent
DEVICES: Medtronic superDimension navigation, Emprint microwave system

IMPRESSION:
Technically successful bronchoscopic electromagnetic navigation with microwave ablation of right middle lobe peripheral adenocarcinoma in 64-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities precluding surgical resection.

PLAN GOING FORWARD:
Patient admitted to pulmonary step-down unit for monitoring. Initial portable chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax. CT chest with contrast performed this evening showed appropriate ablation zone without immediate complications. Patient doing well with minimal pain (3/10) controlled with oral acetaminophen. Planning discharge tomorrow with:

- Close outpatient follow-up in 1 week with repeat chest X-ray
- CT chest at 6-8 weeks for initial response assessment (expecting to see decrease in size of ablation zone with central low attenuation)  
- PET-CT in 3 months to assess metabolic response (successful ablation should show minimal or no FDG uptake)
- Long-term surveillance CT every 3 months for first year, then every 6 months

Patient counseled extensively on post-ablation syndrome (fever, flu-like symptoms possible for 3-5 days - normal inflammatory response). Instructed on warning signs for complications. Patient and husband expressed gratitude and understanding of plan.

Indication: Ground glass opacity requiring biopsy
Target: 23mm nodule in RML

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, procedure, and laterality. An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.

Initial Airway Inspection:
The visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
PRVC	13	356	10	80	5	21

The patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.

Electromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 3.7mm.

The device was navigated to the RML. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB5) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Medial Segment of RML.

Radial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Lesion confirmed at target location.

Crucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.        Esophageal stent migration through distal trachea and left mainstem
2.         Left mainstem occlusion secondary to  esophageal stent
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.        Tracheoesophageal fistula status post tracheal Y-stent placement
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.        Rigid bronchoscopy with esophageal stent removal 
2.        Dynamic Y ( hybrid) Tracheal stent placement
3.        Bronchoscopic intubation
SURGEON: Jordan Parks MD
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction secondary to esophageal stent migration
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm proximal to the main carina an esophageal stent was visualized protruding into the airway causing approximately 30% obstruction of the distal trachea. On closer inspection we could visualize both of the patients telescoping esophageal stent. The proximal end of the inner covered stent could be seen with the origin of the lumen approximately 50% into the airway. The outer uncovered stents proximal origin was seen about 5mm into the distal left mainstem. Additionally a large clip attached to the uncovered outer stent could be seen within the airway. The stents traversed into the left mainstem causing complete occlusion which we could not bypass with the flexible bronchoscope. Bronchial lavage was performed to collect purulent secretions from the airway. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed and a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Using flexible forceps we were able to detach and remove the clip. We were aware that the outer uncovered stent was embedded into the trachea and could not be removed. However, given that the inner stents proximal lumen was within the airway and that this stent was not known to be fixed to tissue we chose to attempt the remove the stent enblock through the airway. Using the rigid forceps the proximal edge of the stent was grasped and slowly withdrawn. Initially the stent moved easily however after retracting approximately 3cm of the stent sudden resistance was encountered and the proximal edge of the stent fractured. Given that a much longer segment of the stent was now within the trachea causing significant obstruction (which also now made placement of a tracheal stent impossible) we had no choice except to attempt to further extract the stent. The stent however was firmly fixed and retraction resulted in further fracture with multiple exposed sires within the trachea. Advanced GI endoscopy was called and came to the OR. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an EGD was performed. The proximal edge of the outer uncovered stent  from the esophageal side was embedded and distorted and could not be passed even with the Ultra slim (6mm) gastroscope.  The rigid bronchoscope was reinserted during EGD to better allow us to visualize the communication and attempt to pass a wire in into the esophagus to place an additional stent but the wire would only pass into the airway and this was subsequently aborted leaving us no choice but to continue to remove the esophageal stent piecemeal. Using multiple techniques to include rigid endoscopic scissors, APC, and forceps we slowly removed exposed wires and attempted to transect the stent to allow airway stent placement. This was extremely difficult as more and more unraveling stent was seen. As both stents migrated further into the airway while extracting exposed wires the majority of the stents had to be removed in a piecemeal fashion. Once the stents were removed, with the exception of some small distal wires, the extent of the fistula (which extended during extraction) became completely apparent with the posterior wall of the trachea essentially absent in the lower third with a large defect at the main carina extending directly into the esophagus. We then attempted to place a 15x12x12 hybrid dynamic Y stent into the airway to occlude the fistula by removing the rigid bronchoscope and using glide-scope laryngoscopy visualizing the vocal cords and directly passing the stent, secured with Freitag forceps, into the trachea. Once the stent was within the airway we inserted a  rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope through the vocal cords proximal to the stent. Due to the large defect at the main carina it was extremely difficult to seat the limbs within the bilateral mainstem and despite multiple attempts utilizing rigid forceps, reverse forceps CRE balloons and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we could not adequately seat the stent. The stent was removed and we then attempted to place a smaller 13X10X10 mm dynamic Y with a 5.5cm tracheal limb, a 2cm right sided limb and a 3cm left sided limb using a similar technique and were eventually able to secure the stent in place. Once this was accomplished a 6.5 ETT was inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope and advanced into the proximal limb of the stent and secured in place.   
Complications:  Extension of TE fistula

-        Appreciate GI recommendations. 
-        Please contact the interventional pulmonary team if any airway issues occur in this patient. Anesthesia is also aware
-        Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.
-        If tracheostomy tube needs to be removed and reinserted this must be performed  with direct visualization of the distal tip as it is inserted into the lumen of the tracheostomy tube to prevent kinking or obstruction of the stent by  the tracheostomy tube.
-        Please do not adjust the endotracheal tubes position or attempt suction unless absolutely necessary (tonight).
-        Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.
-        If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 6.5 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp. On the right there was mucosal changes/eryethema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared un-effected. The BI was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without There was mild structuring on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior and lateral and posterior basal segments partially obstructed from stricture (50%). On the left the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingual was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected. 
Following inspection we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3cm length with a 12,13.5,15 CRE balloon with post dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band like strictures within the lingual, the superior segment of the right lower lobe medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6,7,8 CRE balloon to the lingual, the superior segment of the right lower lobe medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily by passed into the segments. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant central airway obstruction.  
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y- stent placement 
SURGEON: Russell Miller, MD
INDICATIONS: Airway obstruction
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation) we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and has to convert to a 12mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.  Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstem with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patient. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent.  It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue will only mild extrinsic compression. Tumor debulking  was performed using APC to  “burn and shave” the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.
Once we were able to bypass the central tumor the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1cm pass the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement also limited to the first cm pass the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe but the right sided airways were otherwise uninvolved. 
After measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb and 40mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid and using Fritag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to seed the stent into proper position. Post-insertion the trachea, right mainstem and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery. 

Recommendations:
-          Transfer back to ICU
-          Post-procedure x-ray
-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.
-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.
-	If invasive ventilatory support is required blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.
The video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.
Subsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.
The tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.
Persistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.
Following verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.
Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 30 cc
Post-procedure Recommendations: 
-	Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid. 
-	Await pathology results. 
-	Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2. Flexible bronchoscopy.
3. Tracheal silicone stent placement.

SURGEON: Laura Bennett, MD (Interventional Pulmonology)
ASSISTANT: Andrew Park, MD (Thoracic Surgery Fellow)
ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy and jet ventilation.

INDICATION:
73-year-old male with known squamous cell carcinoma of the mid-trachea, presenting with stridor and 80% luminal obstruction on CT and bronchoscopy. Planned rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy with debulking and airway stent placement for palliation and airway stabilization.

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
After induction of general anesthesia, a rigid tracheobronchoscope was introduced under direct visualization. Tumor causing near circumferential narrowing of the mid-trachea over ~3 cm was identified.

Tumor Debulking:
Mechanical debulking was performed using the bevel of the rigid scope and large forceps to core out the intraluminal mass. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) at 35 W and 1.5 L/min flow was then applied circumferentially to residual tumor and bleeding points until a widely patent lumen was obtained. Approximate residual obstruction was < 20% with smooth mucosal surface.

Stent Placement:
A 16 x 50 mm straight silicone Dumon stent was selected. Under direct bronchoscopic visualization, the stent was mounted on the rigid stent loader and deployed across the involved segment. Final position covered the entire tumor bed with adequate proximal and distal margins. The stent was well seated with no migration and good distal ventilation.

The airway was reinspected distally with a flexible bronchoscope through the rigid barrel. No additional endobronchial disease was identified. Secretions were suctioned.

COMPLICATIONS:
Total estimated blood loss ~20 mL. No significant hypoxia, arrhythmia, or airway perforation. No intraoperative complications.

DISPOSITION:
The rigid scope was removed and the patient was transitioned back to a standard ETT and subsequently extubated in the OR. He was transported to PACU on 4 L/min nasal cannula in stable condition. Follow-up CT and bronchoscopy are planned in 4–6 weeks.

PROCEDURES:
1. Ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic right thoracentesis.
2. Insertion of right large-bore chest tube for ongoing drainage.

OPERATOR: Emily Rogers, MD (Pulmonary/Critical Care)
ASSISTANT: ICU Resident PGY-2

INDICATION:
56-year-old male with severe community-acquired pneumonia and enlarging right pleural effusion with loculations and fevers despite antibiotics. Ultrasound reveals complex septated effusion. Bedside thoracentesis for diagnosis followed by chest tube for continued drainage.

ULTRASOUND-GUIDED THORACENTESIS:
The patient was positioned sitting upright. Right posterolateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound identified a moderate, complex right pleural effusion with diaphragmatic excursion and no obvious lung entrapment. A safe window in the right posterior axillary line at the 8th intercostal space was chosen.

Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was infiltrated down to the pleura. A 19G needle with catheter was advanced above the rib under real-time ultrasound guidance into the pleural space with return of turbid, yellow fluid. Approximately 40 mL of fluid was aspirated for diagnostic studies (chemistry, cell count, Gram stain/culture, cytology, pH, LDH, glucose).

CHEST TUBE INSERTION:
Given the thick, loculated nature of the effusion and sepsis, a decision was made to place a large-bore chest tube. A 28 Fr straight chest tube was inserted via a separate incision at the mid-axillary line in the 6th intercostal space using blunt dissection and Seldinger technique into the posterolateral collection. The tube was secured with sutures and connected to -20 cm H2O suction.

Initial drainage was approximately 900 mL of turbid, malodorous fluid. The patient tolerated the procedure without hypotension or significant desaturation. Post-procedure ultrasound confirmed lung expansion, and a CXR was ordered to confirm position and evaluate for complications.

COMPLICATIONS:
No immediate pneumothorax, bleeding, or organ injury was observed.

DISPOSITION:
Patient remained in the ICU on existing vasopressor and ventilator settings. Plan for intrapleural fibrinolytics if imaging shows persistent loculations.

Attending physician: Dr. S. Moreno
Assistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; cytopathology technologist; radiology technologist.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 16 mm peripheral left lower lobe lateral basal segment nodule with intermediate pre-test probability of malignancy.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the lung based on frozen-section biopsy.
Indication: Same-session diagnosis and local treatment of a peripheral lung cancer in a patient with cardiomyopathy and prohibitive surgical risk.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with radial EBUS confirmation.
2. Transbronchial cryobiopsy of left lower lobe nodule with frozen-section analysis.
3. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: The navigation bronchoscope was advanced to the left lower lobe following registration of the planning CT. Radial EBUS demonstrated a concentric hypoechoic lesion. Two transbronchial cryobiopsies were obtained and submitted for frozen section, which confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma. Perilesional hemorrhage caused mild blurring of the lesion margins on fluoroscopy. A CrossCountry needle was then advanced into the lesion and an extended working channel placed. An Emprint catheter was introduced and a single 10-minute ablation performed. Post-ablation cone-beam CT showed a ground-glass ablation zone encompassing the biopsy cavity with an estimated minimal margin of approximately 5 mm, though interpretation was limited by hemorrhage-related opacities. Bronchoscopy at the end of the case demonstrated oozing in the lateral basal subsegment, which resolved with suctioning and topical iced saline.

Postoperative Diagnosis: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Procedure Performed: Flexible bronchoscopy with radial knife incisions and balloon dilatation

Surgeon: Gregory Hamilton, MD
Indications: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords, there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp.

On the right, there were mucosal changes/erythema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared unaffected. The bronchus intermedius was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without significant obstruction. There was mild stricturing on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior, lateral, and posterior basal segments were partially obstructed from stricture (50%).

On the left, the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingula was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected.

Following inspection, we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3 cm length with a 12, 13.5, 15 CRE balloon with post-dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band-like strictures within the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6, 7, 8 CRE balloon to the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments, after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily be passed into the segments. At this point, once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Recommendations:
• Patient to PACU for recovery
• Patient to follow up with me PRN if symptoms return

Surgeon: Robert Chen, MD
Assistant: Sean Foley, MD (Attending)
Indications: Hemoptysis, significant airway obstruction, and need for tissue biopsy
Consent: Informed consent obtained from patient and family after detailed explanation of the procedure, associated risks, benefits, and alternatives.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
Following induction of general anesthesia and insertion of an LMA, topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway. A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.

The video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.

Subsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.

The tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.

Persistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.

Following verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.

Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 30 cc

Post-procedure Recommendations:
- Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid
- Await pathology results
- Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise

Indication: Part-solid nodule for tissue diagnosis
Target: 24mm nodule in LUL

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the RUL Carina (RC1), Bronchus Intermedius, Left Carina (LC2), LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Left Mainstem, RML Carina (RC2), Carina from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
PRVC	14	283	13	80	6	19

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 3.1mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apicoposterior Segment of LUL (LB1+2). Target lesion is approximately 24mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 0.7cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.

Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 7 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 6 seconds was used. Total 3 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance.

Transbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Apicoposterior Segment of LUL (LB1+2). Instilled 60cc of NS, suction returned with 22cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

ROSE Result: Lymphocytes and benign cells, adequate for evaluation

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

**PT INFO:** Rodriguez, Carlos M. | 59M | MRN 6847291
**DOS:** 03/19/2025
**TEAM:** Dr. Amanda Foster (Attending), Dr. Brian Lee (Fellow), RN Maria Santos, RT Kevin Johnson
**ANESTHESIA:** Dr. Michelle Chang - General/ETT

**INDICATION:**
LLL mass 5.1cm with endobronchial extension + extensive mediastinal/hilar adenopathy. Heavy smoker (80 py). Needs diagnosis and staging.

**PROCEDURES:**
- EBUS-TBNA
- Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy
- Radial EBUS
- Transbronchial biopsies
- Endobronchial biopsies

**CONSENT:** Obtained - all risks discussed

**VENT:** PC mode, Pinsp 20, RR 12, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%, Pmean 14

**PROCEDURE:**

**PART 1: EBUS-TBNA**

EBUS scope inserted through ETT (8.0, 23cm).

**Mediastinal Survey:**

**Station 2R:** 7mm - not sampled

**Station 4R:** 24mm - hypoechoic, heterogeneous
- 22G needle x 5 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 4L:** 19mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 7:** 28mm - large, hypoechoic, necrotic areas visible
- 22G needle x 5 passes (some passes yielded necrotic material)
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma, areas of necrosis""

**Station 10L:** 22mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 4 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Station 11L:** 18mm - hypoechoic
- 22G needle x 3 passes
- ROSE: ""Positive - squamous cell carcinoma""

**Assessment after EBUS:** Extensive N2/N3 disease. Primary still needs biopsy for confirmation.

**PART 2: AIRWAY INSPECTION**

EBUS scope removed. Standard bronchoscope inserted.

**Finding:** LLL orifice shows endobronchial tumor - exophytic mass nearly occluding orifice, friable appearance.

**Decision:** Obtain endobronchial biopsies directly (easier/safer than navigating to peripheral component).

**Endobronchial biopsies:** 6 specimens obtained from visible LLL tumor using standard forceps.

Moderate bleeding from biopsy site. Managed with:
- Wedging bronchoscope
- Epinephrine 1:10,000, 5mL instilled
- Held position x 2 minutes
- Bleeding resolved

**ROSE (endobronchial):** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - consistent with nodal samples""

**PART 3: EMN TO PERIPHERAL COMPONENT**

Despite endobronchial component, decided to sample peripheral component as well for potentially better tissue for molecular testing.

SuperDimension EMN system used. CT from 03/05/2025 loaded.

**Registration:** Auto-registration, 7 points, adequate accuracy.

**Navigation:** Attempted to navigate to LLL superior segment (peripheral component of mass). However, significant tumor in proximal airway made navigation difficult. Guide advanced as far as possible but unable to reach planned target (remained ~15mm away per system).

**Radial EBUS:** Probe advanced through guide - visualized mass with eccentric pattern but adequate for sampling.

**Peripheral sampling:**
- Forceps biopsies x 5
- Brushings x 2

**ROSE:** ""Squamous cell carcinoma - adequate for molecular testing""

**TOTAL TIME:** 58 minutes

**EXTUBATION:** Uneventful, stable

**EBL:** ~30mL

**SPECIMENS:**
1. Station 4R TBNA x5
2. Station 4L TBNA x4
3. Station 7 TBNA x5
4. Station 10L TBNA x4
5. Station 11L TBNA x3
6. LLL endobronchial tumor biopsies x6
7. LLL peripheral component biopsies x5 (via EMN)
8. LLL brushings x2

**ALL SPECIMENS:** Request PD-L1 testing (relevant for squamous NSCLC treatment decisions)

**COMPLICATIONS:** Moderate endobronchial bleeding - resolved with epinephrine

**FINDINGS:**
- Extensive nodal disease: N2 (stations 4R, 4L, 7) and N3 (contralateral 4L) involvement
- Primary LLL squamous cell carcinoma with endobronchial extension
- Stage: At least IIIB (T3-4N3M0)

**PLAN:**
- Complete staging: Brain MRI
- Not surgical candidate due to extent of nodal disease
- Medical oncology consult - definitive chemoradiation vs clinical trial
- PD-L1 results may influence systemic therapy choice
- F/u 1 week IP clinic

Post-op CXR: No PTX

**FINDINGS SUMMARY:**

**Based on Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):**

**Primary Tumor:**
- Left lower lobe mass: ADENOCARCINOMA confirmed

**Lymph Node Staging:**
- Station 5 (Aortopulmonary window - contralateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N3 disease)
- Station 7 (Subcarinal - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N2 disease)
- Station 10L (Left hilar - ipsilateral): POSITIVE for malignancy (N1 disease)

**Preliminary Staging:**
- Primary tumor (T): T2b (3.6 cm)
- Regional lymph nodes (N): N3 (contralateral mediastinal node involvement)
- Distant metastasis (M): M0 (no distant metastases identified on PET/CT)
- **Overall Stage: IIIB (T2bN3M0)**

This represents locally advanced disease with contralateral mediastinal lymph node involvement.
**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT & DISCUSSION:**

**Diagnosis:** Stage IIIB Adenocarcinoma of the Left Lower Lobe

**Significance:**
- This is locally advanced lung cancer with extensive nodal involvement
- N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal node) makes this unresectable by surgical standards
- Patient is NOT a surgical candidate given extent of nodal disease
- Will require systemic therapy +/- radiation

**Prognostic Factors - FAVORABLE:**
- Former smoker (quit 8 years ago) - intermediate prognosis
- Good performance status (ECOG 1)
- Age 61 - relatively young
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (better prognosis than squamous, more treatment options)

**Prognostic Factors - UNFAVORABLE:**
- Stage IIIB with N3 disease
- Large primary tumor (3.6 cm)
- Multilevel nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3)

**Treatment Implications:**
- Primary treatment: Concurrent chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy (PACIFIC trial paradigm)
- Alternative: Sequential chemotherapy → radiation, or clinical trial
- Role of radiation: Definitive radiation therapy to primary + involved nodal stations
- Surgical resection: Not indicated given N3 disease
- Molecular testing results will be CRITICAL:
  - If EGFR/ALK/ROS1 positive: Consider targeted therapy incorporation
  - PD-L1 status: Guides immunotherapy selection
  - Other actionable mutations: May have clinical trial options

**Awaiting:**
- Final histopathology confirmation (2-3 business days)
- Comprehensive molecular testing (7-14 days, expedite if possible)
- Formal staging completion (see below)
**PLAN & FOLLOW-UP:**

**1. Staging Completion:**

"Patient: Emily Richardson
MRN: 5183947
Date: April 8, 2022

Preoperative Diagnosis: Respiratory failure secondary to extrinsic tracheal compression
Postoperative Diagnosis: Extrinsic tracheal compression s/p airway stent placement
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy, Silicone Y-stent placement, bronchoscopic intubation

Surgeon: Laura Bennett, MD
Indications: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient's family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated, a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea, inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction (at maximum) of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction extending to approximately 2 cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor.

We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization, the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways.

After measuring the airways, we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75 mm in the tracheal limb, 15 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 30 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.

At this point, inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway, the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete.

Post-procedure Diagnosis: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent

Recommendations:
• Transfer to ICU
• Obtain post-procedure CXR
• TID hypertonic nebulizers to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent

MONITORING: ICU monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, arterial line, telemetry
INSTRUMENT: Olympus bronchoscope, Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous tracheostomy kit, 8.0 Shiley cuffed tracheostomy tube
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Supine with neck extension (shoulder roll)
The bronchoscope was introduced through the existing 8.0 ETT into the trachea. The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized and counted.
With bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck for local anesthesia. A 1cm vertical skin incision was made with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.
A syringe with 1% Lidocaine was attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings into the trachea under direct visualization. Aspiration of air confirmed tracheal entry. The needle was removed and the 18-gauge introducer catheter over needle was advanced into this position under direct visualization.
The inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place. A J-wire was passed through the catheter, visualized with the bronchoscope entering the tracheal lumen. The site was dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.
The 14Fr dilator was removed and an 8Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. The Blue Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter and advanced until the positioning mark (corresponding to 8.0 trach size) was visualized via the bronchoscope between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings.
The Blue Rhino dilator was removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
Finally, a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically with the tip approximately 3cm above the carina.
The endotracheal tube was removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. End-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed appropriate ventilation. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding. A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place with 2-0 nylon sutures.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. The staff physician, Dr. Taylor, was present throughout the entire procedure.

ASSISTANT: Dr. Amy Zhang, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Daniel Martinez
RT: Sarah Johnson
Anesthesia: Dr. Kevin Park

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line
INSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus
The patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.
The bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position and the position of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.
Lavage Procedure:
The patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37°C) 0.9% normal saline.
Serial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:

Aliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment
Aliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment
Aliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid
Aliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid
Aliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid
Aliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear

Total volume instilled: 6000mL
Total volume returned: 5820mL

"Patient: Brian Foster
MRN: 6927483
Date of Procedure: December 7, 2016

Preoperative Diagnosis: Lung mass with left mainstem obstruction
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy

Surgeon: Daniel Carter, MD
Assistant: Monica Taylor, MD
Indications: Left mainstem obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by anesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.

On initial bronchoscopic inspection, there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction.

At this point, the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound. Six biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left mainstem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy, and forceps, we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. An ultrathin bronchoscope was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carinas within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized, but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor overlying this area to confirm distal patency.

Subsequently, the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximately 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem, which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point, the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea, and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

Recommendations:
• Await tissue diagnosis
• ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction
• If patient develops significant hemoptysis post-procedure, would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung
• If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy, will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y-stent

"Patient Name: Michael Thompson
MRN: 7294163
Date of Procedure: March 1, 2021

Preoperative Diagnosis: Malignant central airway obstruction
Postoperative Diagnosis: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y-stent placement

Surgeon: Jennifer Williams, MD
Indications: Airway obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient's family acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives, a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope insertion was attempted. Due to poor mouth opening and glottic irregularities (related to previous head and neck radiation), we were unable to pass the large rigid bronchoscope through the cords and had to convert to a 12 mm rigid ventilating bronchoscope which was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to jet ventilator. Unfortunately, due to a combination of extremely poor dentition and poor mouth opening, two teeth were lost during the intubation procedure.

Airway inspection was performed using the T190 therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the right lateral wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor involving both mainstems with carinal tumor infiltration as well. The distal trachea was about 20% patent. The left mainstem was completely occluded and the right mainstem was 30% patent. It appeared that intrinsic tumor ingrowth was the predominant issue with only mild extrinsic compression.

Tumor debulking was performed using APC to ""burn and shave"" the tumor within the trachea and proximal bilateral mainstem along with cryotherapy to remove loose debris and blood clots.

Once we were able to bypass the central tumor, the left mainstem tumor only extended about 1 cm past the main carina and the distal left mainstem and left-sided bronchi were normal and fully patent. The right mainstem involvement was also limited to the first cm past the main carina. There was non-obstructive tumor infiltration in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, but the right-sided airways were otherwise uninvolved.

After measuring the airways, we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 65 mm in the tracheal limb, 17.5 mm in the right mainstem limb, and 40 mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed as the stent was too large to insert through the rigid, and using Freitag forceps along with a bougie inserted into the left limb, we were able to blindly pass the stent through the vocal cords into the trachea. The rigid bronchoscope was then re-inserted. Through the use of rigid forceps and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope, we were eventually able to seat the stent into proper position. Post-insertion, the trachea, right mainstem, and left mainstem were all at least 90% patent. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope and turned over the case to anesthesia for recovery.

Recommendations:
- Transfer back to ICU
- Post-procedure x-ray
- Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance
- Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
- Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge
- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction. Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula secondary to esophageal CA 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula secondary to esophageal CA 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, Tracheal self-expandable airway stent removal
SURGEON: Mikie Gallegos, MD
INDICATIONS: Stent migration and presumed stent infection
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords the patients previous stent could be visualized. Throughout the stent were thick purulent material consistent with infection. The telescoped distal tracheal stent was noted to have migrated into the right mainstem causing complete occlusion of the left mainstem. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid and into the stent. Bronchial lavage was performed with specimen obtained by trap and sent for culture. The proximal edge of the distal telescoped stent was visualized and using flexible forceps we secured the proximal knot and attempted to withdraw the stent. The stent moved only slightly but enough to visualize copious amounts of post-obstructive pus being expressed from the previously obstructed left mainstem. The material was collected in a trap for culture. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps. The proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent. Both stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope. The airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass. The patient’s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula. The airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 

Post procedure diagnosis:
-	Stent infection
-	Stent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.
-	Persistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent 
-	s/p airway stent removal
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Await cultures
- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula
- Saline nebs 2-3 times per day for 3 days to thin residual blood and secretions allowing for expectoration.

INDICATIONS: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent was obtained from the patient’s family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction(at maximum)  of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction  extending to approximately 2cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor. We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. After measuring the airways we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75mm in the tracheal limb, 15mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete
Post procedure diagnosis:
Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent.

MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum

COMPLICATIONS:	None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.
Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.
Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. 
Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process
Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.
Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 

SPECIMEN(S): 
TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.
BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Logan Pierce is a 76 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

Physician: Dr. Priya Patel, MD, FCCP
CT Surgery Consultant: Dr. Robert Chen, MD
Fellow: Dr. Kevin Wu, MD

INDICATION: Severe COPD with giant bulla RUL, persistent air leak following RUL bullectomy

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial valve placement for persistent air leak management

CONSENT: Extended discussion regarding use of valves for air leak (off-label indication). Risks discussed including valve migration, persistent air leak, infection, bleeding, respiratory failure. Patient and family understood and agreed.

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:
Patient brought to IP suite with existing chest tube in place demonstrating persistent air leak (large continuous bubbling). Pre-procedure chest CT reviewed showing large residual apical cavity communicating with RUL bronchi.

Moderate sedation achieved. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed:
- Normal larynx and trachea
- RUL: Visualization of communication between RB1 and apical cavity
- Active ""sucking"" noted at RB1 entrance correlating with air leak

INTERVENTION:
Attempted placement of 5.5mm Zephyr valve in RB1. Initial deployment appeared satisfactory.

COMPLICATION:
Immediately following valve placement, patient developed acute desaturation to 82% on 4L NC. Simultaneously noted increase in subcutaneous emphysema and asymmetric chest wall movement. Immediately suspected tension pneumothorax.

MANAGEMENT:
- Procedure aborted
- 100% O2 applied
- Emergency portable CXR confirmed large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift
- Cardiothoracic surgery emergently consulted
- Second chest tube placed (28Fr) with immediate improvement
- Patient stabilized

ADDITIONAL VALVE PLACEMENT:
After stabilization and with CT surgery at bedside, decision made to place additional valve in RB3 to reduce overall flow into cavity.
- 4.0mm valve placed in RB3 without incident
- Air leak notably reduced but not eliminated

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
- Partial success: Air leak reduced from large to moderate
- Complication: Iatrogenic pneumothorax requiring second chest tube
- Both chest tubes to suction with water seal

POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:
- ICU admission  
- Serial CXRs
- Consider additional valve placement if air leak persists after 72 hours
- Family meeting held, understanding confirmed

ASSISTANT: Patricia Hogan MD
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina’s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Await tissue diagnosis
ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.
If patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. 
If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Preoperative Diagnosis: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Postoperative Diagnosis: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis secondary to Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Procedure Performed: Flexible bronchoscopy with radial knife incisions and balloon dilatation

Surgeon: Gregory Hamilton, MD
Indications: Tracheal and bronchial stenosis
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords, there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp.

On the right, there were mucosal changes/erythema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared unaffected. The bronchus intermedius was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without significant obstruction. There was mild stricturing on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior, lateral, and posterior basal segments were partially obstructed from stricture (50%).

On the left, the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingula was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected.

Following inspection, we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3 cm length with a 12, 13.5, 15 CRE balloon with post-dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band-like strictures within the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6, 7, 8 CRE balloon to the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments, after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily be passed into the segments. At this point, once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Recommendations:
• Patient to PACU for recovery
• Patient to follow up with me PRN if symptoms return

Surgeon: Robert Chen, MD
Assistant: Sean Foley, MD (Attending)
Indications: Hemoptysis, significant airway obstruction, and need for tissue biopsy
Consent: Informed consent obtained from patient and family after detailed explanation of the procedure, associated risks, benefits, and alternatives.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
Following induction of general anesthesia and insertion of an LMA, topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway. A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.

The video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.

Subsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.

The tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.

Persistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.

Following verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.

Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 30 cc

Post-procedure Recommendations:
- Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid
- Await pathology results
- Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise

TV: 500mL
PEEP: 5 cmH₂O
FiO₂: 40%
Flow Rate: 50 L/min
Pmean: 14 cmH₂O

Navigation Planning:
CT Chest scan from 9/28/2024 was placed on the separate planning station (Synapse Lung) to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target nodule in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe (LB9). The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Target lesion characteristics:

Location: LLL, lateral basal segment (LB9)
Size: 1.8cm
Distance from pleura: 1.2cm
Bronchus sign: Present

Ion Registration - Complete:

Main carina
Left main carina
LLL segmental carinas
Tertiary bifurcations in LB9

Mean fiducial error: 3.8mm
Global alignment quality: Excellent
No registration drift observed during the case
A confidence sweep confirmed stable targeting throughout the planned trajectory with virtual-to-live alignment within acceptable parameters.
Navigation:
The Ion catheter was advanced under navigational guidance through the left mainstem bronchus, into the LLL, and subsequently into the LB9 segment. The robotic system provided real-time feedback with shape sensing technology.
Target reached notification appeared when catheter tip was 0.6cm from the planned target center.
Radial EBUS Confirmation:
Radial EBUS probe (1.4mm) was passed through the Ion extended working channel to confirm lesion location. The following features were noted:

Pattern: Concentric
Echogenicity: Heterogeneous
Lesion size by REBUS: 19mm

Attending: Dr. Nicole Turner
Clinical Summary: Patient is a 66 year old gentleman presenting with a large right sided pleural effusion, unclear etiology. Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.
We discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.
Procedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement
How it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.
Through the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.
Multiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.
After biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.
Pathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry
Patient did well throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.
Follow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation. Patient understands may need indwelling pleural catheter if lung doesn't re-expand.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Patient: Jennifer Wu, 58 yo female
Date: October 17, 2024
Doc: Dr. Steven Park
MRN: 1690514
So Ms. Wu came in today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.
Brought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).
So here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.
After cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.
The distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.
Did a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.
Recommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.
Overall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

CLINICAL HISTORY & INDICATION
Mrs. Okafor is a 65-year-old Nigerian-American female with a complex medical history including stage IIIB adenocarcinoma of the right lung (diagnosed 04/2023), status post chemoradiation therapy (completed 10/2023). She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 3 months and was found to have:

Right mainstem bronchus obstruction - Interval CT imaging from 10/10/2024 shows tumor recurrence causing 85% obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonitis of the entire right lung
Malignant pericardial effusion - Echo from 10/15/2024 showed moderate-large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology (RA collapse)
Right malignant pleural effusion - Thoracentesis 10/18/2024 confirmed malignant cells

The patient presented to our interventional pulmonology clinic 10/20/2024 with severe dyspnea (MMRC grade 4), inability to lie flat, oxygen requirement of 4L NC at rest. Given the multiple sites requiring intervention and the patient's overall debilitated status, the decision was made to address all issues in a single procedure session to minimize anesthetic exposures.
MULTIDISCIPLINARY PLANNING
Pre-procedure conference held 10/23/2024 with IP, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, and anesthesia. Plan formulated:

Address airway obstruction first (most critical)
Follow with pericardial window creation

Attending: Russell J. Miller, MD
Anesthesia: General Anesthesia
Monitoring: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

Instrument:
• Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
• Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

Estimated Blood Loss: Minimum
Complications: None

Procedure in Detail:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform. Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.

Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.

Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.

Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.

Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.

Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

Specimen(s):
• TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture
• Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture
• BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology

Impression/Plan: Douglas Diaz is a 74-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

Recommendations:
• Transfer to PACU
• Obtain chest X-ray
• Discharge home once cleared by PACU
• Await pathology and culture results and based on findings follow up for EBV insertion for COPD

"PATIENT: Maria Rodriguez, 38-year-old Female
MRN: 6905843
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: Ms. Rodriguez is a 38-year-old female with biopsy-proven pulmonary alveolar proteinosis presenting with progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia refractory to medical management. PFTs show restrictive pattern with DLCO 45% predicted. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to whole lung lavage were discussed with the patient in detail. Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same
PROCEDURE: Whole Lung Lavage (CPT 32997)
ATTENDING: Dr. Richard Brown
ASSISTANT: Dr. Amy Zhang, Fellow
Support Staff:

RN: Daniel Martinez
RT: Sarah Johnson
Anesthesia: Dr. Kevin Park

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with TIVA
MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line
INSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus
The patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.
The bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position and the position of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.
Lavage Procedure:
The patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37°C) 0.9% normal saline.
Serial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:

Aliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment
Aliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment
Aliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid
Aliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid
Aliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid
Aliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear

Total volume instilled: 6000mL
Total volume returned: 5820mL
Net balance: -180mL (absorbed)
The effluent became progressively clearer. Lavage was discontinued when return fluid was nearly clear. Throughout the procedure, oxygen saturation remained >94% on the ventilated right lung. End-tidal CO2 remained stable at 38-42 mmHg.
After completion of lavage, gentle suctioning was performed through the left bronchial lumen. Bilateral lung ventilation was resumed. DLT position was reconfirmed. The patient was transported to PACU intubated for extubation after full recovery from anesthesia.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Brown, was present throughout the entire procedure.
SPECIMEN(S):

Lavage fluid (first aliquot) sent for cell count, cytology, and periodic acid-Schiff staining

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Rodriguez underwent successful whole lung lavage of the left lung for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Procedure completed without complications. Patient will undergo right lung lavage in 4-6 weeks pending clinical response. Post-procedure CXR shows expected mild bilateral infiltrates, no pneumothorax. Plan for 6-minute walk test and PFTs in 4 weeks to assess response. GM-CSF therapy to be discussed with pulmonology.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Patient: Brian Foster
MRN: 6927483
Date of Procedure: December 7, 2016

Preoperative Diagnosis: Lung mass with left mainstem obstruction
Postoperative Diagnosis: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction
Procedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy

Surgeon: Daniel Carter, MD
Assistant: Monica Taylor, MD
Indications: Left mainstem obstruction
Consent: Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia

Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by anesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.

On initial bronchoscopic inspection, there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction.

At this point, the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound. Six biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left mainstem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy, and forceps, we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. An ultrathin bronchoscope was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carinas within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized, but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor overlying this area to confirm distal patency.

Subsequently, the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximately 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem, which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point, the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea, and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.

Recommendations:
• Await tissue diagnosis
• ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction
• If patient develops significant hemoptysis post-procedure, would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung
• If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy, will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y-stent

DATE OF PROCEDURE: November 18, 2025
INSTITUTION: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH
OPERATOR: Dr. Richard Patel, MD (Director, Thoracic Innovation Laboratory)

PRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Left upper lobe peripheral nodule, 1.9 cm, proven squamous cell carcinoma

PROCEDURE: Bronchoscopic Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) of pulmonary nodule - INVESTIGATIONAL

*** INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) PROTOCOL #BR-PFA-2024-017 ***
*** FDA-APPROVED CLINICAL TRIAL: PULSE-LUNG Phase II Study ***

INFORMED CONSENT: Extended discussion with patient regarding investigational nature of pulsed field ablation for lung tumors. Patient enrolled in IRB-approved protocol. Detailed explanation of traditional ablation alternatives (microwave, RFA, cryo). Patient elected to participate after reviewing consent documents and meeting with research coordinator.

TECHNIQUE:
General anesthesia. ENB performed with illumiSite platform. Target: LUL apicoposterior segment. Radial EBUS confirmation of lesion. Novel PFA catheter (FarapulsePulm system, 3.0mm diameter, bipolar electrode configuration) advanced through extended working channel. IMPORTANT: PFA uses rapid electrical pulses (1000-2000 V/cm) to create irreversible electroporation of cell membranes WITHOUT thermal damage - fundamentally different mechanism than traditional ablation modalities.

ABLATION PARAMETERS:
- Pulse duration: 100 microseconds
- Number of pulses: 80 per cycle  
- Pulse frequency: 1 Hz
- Number of treatment cycles: 3
- Inter-cycle pause: 30 seconds
- Voltage: 1500 V (adjusted based on impedance 80-120 ohms)
- Energy delivery: Non-thermal (avoids bronchial damage, theoretically preserves adjacent structures)

INTRAPROCEDURAL MONITORING:
Advanced impedance mapping performed throughout treatment showing successful energy delivery to entire tumor volume. Real-time EBUS post-ablation showed immediate increased echogenicity within tumor - consistent with cellular disruption from electroporation. No thermal injury pattern noted on adjacent bronchial walls (major advantage of PFA technology).

OUTCOMES: 
Successfully completed per protocol. No arrhythmias noted (ECG monitoring showed stable rhythm - PFA timed to occur outside cardiac vulnerable period). Patient hemodynamically stable. Airways intact, no hemorrhage.

NOVEL FINDINGS: 
PFA appears to cause more homogeneous ablation zone compared to thermal modalities. Real-time elastography (investigational feature) suggested complete tumor necrosis immediately post-procedure.

DISPOSITION: Research protocol follow-up including CT at 48 hours, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks with volumetric analysis. Patient enrolled in long-term registry (5-year follow-up).

Research coordinator contacted. Data forms completed.

Given the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.

Deep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.

Technical Details:
The electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension™) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning identified optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.

The extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.

Radiation Exposure:
Total fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes
Dose-area product: 268 cGy·cm²
(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)

Sampling Protocol:
Following tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:
- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)
- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens
- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples

COMPLICATIONS:
Small apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was identified on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.

QUALITY METRICS:
- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved
- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)
- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete
- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology

DISCUSSION:
This case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

INDICATIONS: Severe extrinsic tracheal compression
Consent was obtained from the patient’s family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated a flexible Q190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the ETT into the trachea and airway inspection was performed. Beginning in the mid trachea inflammation was seen within the airway walls extending into the bilateral mainstem with approximately 90% obstruction(at maximum)  of the tracheal lumen most prominent in the mid trachea with less extensive obstruction  extending to approximately 2cm above the carina. There was no endobronchial tumor. We subsequently removed the flexible bronchoscope and after administration of paralytics a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supraglottic space. The previously placed endotracheal tube was visualized passing through the vocal cords. Under direct visualization the endotracheal tube was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The Q190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. After measuring the airways we customized a 16x13x13 silicone Y-stent to a length of 75mm in the tracheal limb, 15mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway obstruction. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was complete
Post procedure diagnosis:
Severe extrinsic tracheal compression s/p successful deployment of silicone tracheal Y-stent.

1.         Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation
SURGEON: Aria Winslow, MD
ASSISTANT: Owen Mallory MD
INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.
Recommendations: 
•	Transfer patient back to ward room 
•	Await final pathology results  
•	Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.

MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum

COMPLICATIONS:	None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
    The therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube adaptor and advanced into the trachea. The trachea was thoroughly examined, revealing a sharp carina. The bronchial tree was inspected bilaterally to the subsegmental level, with the mucosa appearing smooth and uniformly pink. No nodularity, lesions, abnormal secretions, airway narrowing, or distortion was noted.

Navigation and Targeting:
A CT chest scan was displayed on a separate planning station to generate a three-dimensional rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Robotic navigation was performed using the Ion platform with partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3), targeting a lesion approximately 1.4 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to within 2.5 cm of the planned target.
Cone Beam CT Imaging:
A cone beam CT was obtained using the Cios Spin system with a low-dose spin protocol. Three-dimensional reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation, and the images were transmitted to the Ion platform. Based on the updated nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted accordingly. I personally reviewed and interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstructions.
Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA):
A TBNA was performed using a 23G needle via the extended working channel catheter. A subsequent low-dose CT spin confirmed appropriate tool placement within the lesion. Additional TBNA samples (total of six) were then obtained using both 21G Needle and 23G Needle. All samples were sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsy:
Transbronchial cryobiopsies were performed using a 1.1 mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter with a freeze time of 6 seconds per sample. A total of five samples were collected and sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):
A BAL was performed through the extended working channel catheter by instilling 20 cc of normal saline, with 10 cc returned. Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology. 
Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE):
ROSE from the Ion procedure revealed Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process
Additional BAL:
After completion of the robotic bronchoscopy, the therapeutic bronchoscope was reinserted, and a BAL was performed in the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1). Forty cc of normal saline was instilled with a 20 cc return, and samples were sent for Cell Count.
Chartis Evaluation:
A Chartis evaluation of the left upper lobe was performed to assess for collateral ventilation in anticipation of future endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment. Balloon occlusion using the Chartis system in the target left upper lobe confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation as evidenced by the cessation of the air leak.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 

SPECIMEN(S): 
TBNA (RUL): Peripheral nodule sample sent for pathology and culture.
Transbronchial Cryobiopsies (RUL): Peripheral nodule samples sent for pathology and culture.
BAL (RUL): Specimen sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, and cytology.

IMPRESSION/PLAN: Logan Pierce is a 76 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of an RUL peripheral nodule as well as a Chartis examination of the left upper lobe in preparation for potential EBV treatment. Collateral ventilation status was confirmed.

Physician: Dr. Priya Patel, MD, FCCP
CT Surgery Consultant: Dr. Robert Chen, MD
Fellow: Dr. Kevin Wu, MD

INDICATION: Severe COPD with giant bulla RUL, persistent air leak following RUL bullectomy

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial valve placement for persistent air leak management

CONSENT: Extended discussion regarding use of valves for air leak (off-label indication). Risks discussed including valve migration, persistent air leak, infection, bleeding, respiratory failure. Patient and family understood and agreed.

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:
Patient brought to IP suite with existing chest tube in place demonstrating persistent air leak (large continuous bubbling). Pre-procedure chest CT reviewed showing large residual apical cavity communicating with RUL bronchi.

Moderate sedation achieved. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed:
- Normal larynx and trachea
- RUL: Visualization of communication between RB1 and apical cavity
- Active ""sucking"" noted at RB1 entrance correlating with air leak

INTERVENTION:
Attempted placement of 5.5mm Zephyr valve in RB1. Initial deployment appeared satisfactory.

COMPLICATION:
Immediately following valve placement, patient developed acute desaturation to 82% on 4L NC. Simultaneously noted increase in subcutaneous emphysema and asymmetric chest wall movement. Immediately suspected tension pneumothorax.

MANAGEMENT:
- Procedure aborted
- 100% O2 applied
- Emergency portable CXR confirmed large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift
- Cardiothoracic surgery emergently consulted
- Second chest tube placed (28Fr) with immediate improvement
- Patient stabilized

ADDITIONAL VALVE PLACEMENT:
After stabilization and with CT surgery at bedside, decision made to place additional valve in RB3 to reduce overall flow into cavity.
- 4.0mm valve placed in RB3 without incident
- Air leak notably reduced but not eliminated

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
- Partial success: Air leak reduced from large to moderate
- Complication: Iatrogenic pneumothorax requiring second chest tube
- Both chest tubes to suction with water seal

POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:
- ICU admission  
- Serial CXRs
- Consider additional valve placement if air leak persists after 72 hours
- Family meeting held, understanding confirmed

SURGEON: Russell Miller, MD 
ASSISTANT: Patricia Hogan MD
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. A 7.0 ETT was placed by ansesthesia followed by OG tube to decompress the stomach. The ETT was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection there was mild bleeding and airway trauma noted in the distal trachea likely secondary to trauma from ETT placement. The posterior and left wall of the distal trachea had obvious submucosal tumor infiltration. The left mainstem bronchus was completely obstructed by endoluminal tumor and the tumor involved the main carina with a mild degree of tumor ingrowth into the right mainstem but without obstruction. At this point the EBUS bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the subcarinal mass was identified with ultrasound and 6 biopsies were performed with the 22G EBUS TBNA needle. We then directed our attention to the left maintem. Through the use of a combination of APC, rigid electrocautery, cryotherapy and forcpts we were able to slowly debulk the tumor within the left mainstem and visualize an opening into the distal left mainstem. A ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from her post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina’s within the left upper lobe and there was no obvious tumor seen. The left lower lobe was visualized but we were unable to adequately debulk the tumor to overlying this area to confirm distal patency. Subseuqently the left mainstem bronchus was dilated with an 8-9-10 CRE balloon with approximaly 50% improvement in luminal patency in the left mainstem which allowed introduction of the therapeutic bronchoscope. At this point the infiltrating friable areas of tumor within the left mainstem, distal trachea and main carina were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Await tissue diagnosis
ASAP radiation oncology consultation for treatment of the left mainstem to attempt to prevent recurrent obstruction.
If patient develops significant hemoptysis post procedure would perform bronchoscopic intubation of the right mainstem to protect functional lung. 
If obstruction recurs despite radiation therapy will likely require repeat rigid bronchoscopy with placement of silicone Y stent.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

MEDICAL RECORD NUMBER: 2025-IP-9847
DATE OF BIRTH: 03/08/1955 (Age 70 years)
PROCEDURE DATE: October 15, 2025
INSTITUTION: Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Kevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP
FELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)
ANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on 09/22/2025 yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative

OPERATION PERFORMED:
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule

CLINICAL SCENARIO:
Patient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. 

General anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. 

Olympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:
- Normal supraglottic structures
- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia
- Carina: sharp, mobile
- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy
- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from 10/05/2025 with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment identified at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.

Registration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). 

Steerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.

Radial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.

Fluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).

Cryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:

Cycle 1: 
- Freeze time: 6 minutes
- Temperature at probe tip: -165°C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)
- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20°C)

Cycle 2:
- Freeze time: 6 minutes  
- Temperature: -167°C
- Passive thaw: 4 minutes

Cycle 3:
- Freeze time: 5 minutes
- Temperature: -163°C
- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)

Throughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.

Post-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.

Cryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:
- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)
- No hemorrhage
- No airway perforation
- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)

Complete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. 

Bronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.

FINDINGS:
1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target
2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)
3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS
4. No procedural complications

SPECIMENS: None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL

INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution

COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively

DRAINS/TUBES: None placed

POST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:
1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring
2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications
4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging
5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain
6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)
7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen
8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake
9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated
10. Diet as tolerated
11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course
- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray
- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)
- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation
- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually

DISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:
Extensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.

Total procedure time: 94 minutes
Fluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes

**URGENT CASE - POST-BIOPSY HEMORRHAGE MANAGEMENT**

ORIGINAL PROCEDURE: Transthoracic needle biopsy RUL nodule by interventional radiology (performed 11/07/2025, 1430hrs). Biopsy complicated by significant hemorrhage with hemothorax development requiring chest tube placement. Patient transferred to ICU overnight. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.

MODIFIED INDICATION: 
Given active bleeding from biopsy site and confirmed malignancy, multidisciplinary discussion between interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Decision made for bronchoscopic approach to: (1) achieve hemostasis and (2) treat tumor definitively with ablation given high surgical risk and desire to avoid repeat intervention.

**EMERGENT BRONCHOSCOPY WITH RFA - MODIFIED PROTOCOL**

Patient still with chest tube in place (right pigtail, 14Fr). Active output decreased but persistent blood-tinged drainage 50mL/hr. Hemoglobin stable at 9.2 after transfusion.

PROCEDURE (Performed 11/08/2025, 0800hrs):
General anesthesia, intubation. Bronchoscopy showed blood in RUL but no active endobronchial source. ENB navigation to RUL posterior segment biopsy site/tumor location. Immediate goal: hemostasis. Secondary goal: tumor ablation.

RFA probe (VIVANT, 1.5cm tip) placed at hemorrhage site within tumor. Treatment modified from standard protocol:
- Initial lower power (40W x 3min) for cauterization/hemostasis
- Then standard ablation (90°C x 8min) for tumor treatment
- Careful monitoring for increased bleeding during treatment

OUTCOME: 
Successfully achieved hemostasis - no further bleeding noted post-ablation. Tumor ablation completed per protocol. Chest tube output decreased to <10mL/hr serosanguinous fluid immediately post-procedure.

COMPLICATIONS: None additional

MODIFIED PLAN:
- ICU monitoring continues
- Chest tube remains, anticipate removal tomorrow if output <50mL/24hr
- CT chest at 48hr  
- Standard post-ablation follow-up once acute issues resolved

**UNUSUAL CASE DISCUSSION:**
This represents off-label use of bronchoscopic RFA for both hemostasis and tumor treatment following complicated transthoracic biopsy. While not standard indication, multidisciplinary team felt this was best approach to manage both bleeding and provide definitive treatment in one procedure. Case to be presented at morbidity/mortality conference for systems review of management pathway.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT POSITION: Sitting upright at 60 degrees, right arm elevated
CHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: (Image saved and printed)

Hemithorax: Right
Pleural Effusion Volume: Large
Echogenicity: Anechoic
Loculations: None
Diaphragmatic Motion: Diminished
Lung sliding before procedure: Present
Lung consolidation/atelectasis: Present (compressive atelectasis)
Pleura: Mildly thickened, no nodularity visualized

The right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to identify the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.
ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract
Entry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space
Location: Mid-axillary line
Procedure Steps:

A finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038"" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.
Two 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.
The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.
Serial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.
The guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).
The introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).
The catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.
Sterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).

Exit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line
Initial Drainage:
The PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.

Navigation Planning:
CT Chest scan from 9/28/2024 was placed on the separate planning station (Synapse Lung) to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target nodule in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe (LB9). The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform.
Target lesion characteristics:

Location: LLL, lateral basal segment (LB9)
Size: 1.8cm
Distance from pleura: 1.2cm
Bronchus sign: Present

Ion Registration - Complete:
Registration to the pre-procedure CT was completed using automatic methods. Adequate airway landmark matching achieved at:

Main carina
Left main carina
LLL segmental carinas
Tertiary bifurcations in LB9

Mean fiducial error: 3.8mm
Global alignment quality: Excellent
No registration drift observed during the case
A confidence sweep confirmed stable targeting throughout the planned trajectory with virtual-to-live alignment within acceptable parameters.
Navigation:
The Ion catheter was advanced under navigational guidance through the left mainstem bronchus, into the LLL, and subsequently into the LB9 segment. The robotic system provided real-time feedback with shape sensing technology.
Target reached notification appeared when catheter tip was 0.6cm from the planned target center.
Radial EBUS Confirmation:
Radial EBUS probe (1.4mm) was passed through the Ion extended working channel to confirm lesion location. The following features were noted:

Pattern: Concentric
Echogenicity: Heterogeneous
Lesion size by REBUS: 19mm
Distance to pleura: 11mm
Vessel proximity: No large vessels within 5mm

Cone-Beam CT Verification:
Mobile C-arm CBCT spin was performed with the Ion catheter in position. Three-dimensional reconstruction confirmed:

Catheter tip within lesion margins
Distance from lesion center: 4mm
Trajectory angle: Optimal for sampling
No pleural transgression

Sampling:

Attending: Dr. Nicole Turner
Clinical Summary: Patient is a 66 year old gentleman presenting with a large right sided pleural effusion, unclear etiology. Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.
We discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.
Procedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement
How it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.
Through the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.
Multiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.
After biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.
Pathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry
Patient did well throughout. No complications. Transferred to floor with chest tube to suction at -20cmH2O. Post procedure CXR pending.
Follow up plan: Monitor drainage. Chest tube likely to stay for several days given trapped lung. Await pathology. If malignancy confirmed, will need oncology consultation. Patient understands may need indwelling pleural catheter if lung doesn't re-expand.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

"Bronchoscopy Note
Patient: Jennifer Wu, 58 yo female
Date: October 17, 2024
Doc: Dr. Steven Park
MRN: 1690514
So Ms. Wu came in today for her routine stent check. She's about 3 months out from when we placed that 14mm Dumon silicone stent in her left mainstem for malignant compression from lung cancer. She's been doing pretty well overall, no new dyspnea, though she mentioned maybe a bit more cough the last week or so.
Brought her over to the procedure room, gave her moderate sedation with the usual versed and fentanyl, topped up with some propofol. Once she was comfortable we got the scope in through her trach (she ended up needing a trach about 2 weeks after the stent because of overall disease progression).
So here's what I found: The trachea above the stent looks okay, maybe a touch more secretions than last time but nothing crazy. The stent itself is still in good position - hasn't migrated at all which is great. But there's definitely more mucous buildup than I'd like to see. Spent a good 10 minutes doing aggressive suctioning and toilet of the stent lumen. Got a bunch of thick tan-colored secretions out.
After cleaning it out I could see the proximal end of the stent has some mild granulation tissue forming - maybe 10% of the circumference, not enough to cause obstruction yet but something we'll need to watch. Thought about hitting it with APC today but honestly it wasn't causing any flow limitation so I decided to just keep an eye on it.
The distal end of the stent is sitting right where it should be. I could see the LUL and LLL takeoffs through the stent - both still patent. The tumor outside the stent looks about the same as last time, maybe slightly more bulky but hard to say. Stent is doing its job keeping the airway open though, I'd estimate we still have about 80% patency which is solid.
Did a quick peek at the right side while I was in there - everything looks normal, no new issues.
Recommendations going forward: I think we need to bring her back a bit sooner than usual, maybe 4 weeks instead of 8, just to make sure that granulation tissue doesn't get out of hand. Also talked to her about increasing her nebulizer treatments to help keep secretions looser. Started her on a 5 day course of azithromycin since the secretions looked a bit purulent.
Overall I'm happy with how the stent is functioning. The main challenge is going to be managing secretion burden and staying on top of any granulation tissue. Patient tolerated the procedure well, no complications, she'll follow up with me in 4 weeks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Name: Rebecca Martinez
Age/Sex: 68/Female
MRN: 1812736
Date: October 21, 2024
Location: Bedside, ICU Room 437
Attending Physician: Dr. Thomas Anderson
Indication: Recurrent malignant pleural effusion (metastatic ovarian cancer), right-sided, despite optimal drainage via chest tube
Background: Patient has had 28Fr chest tube in place for 5 days. Initial drainage was 1400mL, then decreased to <100mL/day for the past 48 hours. CXR today shows good lung expansion with only minimal residual pleural fluid. No air leak present. Patient is appropriate candidate for pleurodesis.
Consent: Obtained from patient. Risks discussed include chest pain/discomfort, fever, respiratory distress (rare), failure of pleurodesis requiring repeat procedure.
Premedication:

Morphine 4mg IV given 30 minutes prior
Acetaminophen 1000mg PO given 1 hour prior
Ondansetron 4mg IV given for nausea prophylaxis


PROCEDURE STEPS:
Step 1 - Verification (Time: 14:00)

Verified chest tube patency by flushing with 10mL sterile saline
Confirmed no air leak on water seal
Reviewed most recent CXR with radiologist - confirmed adequate lung expansion

Step 2 - Lidocaine Administration (Time: 14:05)

Drew up 20mL of 1% lidocaine (200mg total)
Administered through chest tube slowly over 2 minutes
Clamped tube for 5 minutes to allow lidocaine to distribute
Released clamp, allowed to drain

Step 3 - Talc Slurry Preparation (Time: 14:15)

Prepared sterile talc slurry: 4 grams talc powder in 50mL normal saline
Mixed thoroughly in sterile cup until uniform suspension achieved
Drew up into 60mL catheter tip syringe

Step 4 - Talc Administration (Time: 14:20)

Slowly instilled talc slurry through chest tube over 5 minutes
Followed with 20mL normal saline flush to ensure complete delivery
Immediately clamped chest tube

Step 5 - Position Changes (Time: 14:25 - 15:25)
Patient rotated through positions every 15 minutes to distribute talc:

Position 1 (14:25): Supine - 15 minutes
Position 2 (14:40): Right lateral decubitus - 15 minutes
Position 3 (14:55): Prone (as tolerated) - 10 minutes
Position 4 (15:05): Left lateral decubitus - 15 minutes
Position 5 (15:20): Return to supine - 5 minutes

Total dwell time: 60 minutes
Step 6 - Resumption of Drainage (Time: 15:25)

Released clamp on chest tube
Connected back to suction at -20 cmH2O
Immediate return of approximately 30mL serosanguineous fluid


PATIENT TOLERANCE:
During procedure:

Vital signs stable throughout
Complained of moderate chest discomfort (5/10) during position changes
Received additional morphine 2mg IV at 14:50
No respiratory distress
Oxygen saturation maintained >94% on 2L NC

Post-procedure (2 hours observation):

Chest discomfort decreased to 3/10
No fever (temp 37.2°C)
No dyspnea
Chest tube draining serosanguineous fluid, approximately 50mL total since unclamping

SPECIMENS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
POST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:

Continue chest tube to suction -20 cmH2O
Monitor drainage every 4 hours
Pain control: Morphine 2-4mg IV q4h PRN, acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h scheduled
Chest X-ray in AM
If drainage <150mL over next 24 hours AND CXR shows no reaccumulation, consider chest tube removal in 48-72 hours

ASSESSMENT: Chemical pleurodesis with talc slurry via chest tube completed successfully without complications. Patient tolerated procedure reasonably well with adequate pain control. Will monitor for pleurodesis efficacy over next several days.
Follow-up Plan:

Daily CXR while chest tube in place
Remove chest tube when drainage criteria met (typically 2-3 days)
Follow-up CXR 1 week after chest tube removal
If recurrent effusion develops, may consider PleurX catheter placement",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
