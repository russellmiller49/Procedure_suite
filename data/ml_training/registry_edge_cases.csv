**Procedure:** Rigid Bronchoscopy, Stent Removal, Laser Resection, New Stent Placement.
**Anesthesia:** General (TIVA). Jet Ventilation.

**Details:**
Rigid bronchoscope (14mm) inserted. The existing silicone stent was found migrated into the right mainstem, partially obstructing the RUL. Using rigid forceps, the stent was grasped, folded, and removed en bloc.

Inspection revealed exophytic tumor regrowth at the mid-trachea (proximal to old stent site) causing 70% obstruction. 
Nd:YAG Laser was applied (40W) to coagulate and vaporize the tumor. Mechanical coring with the rigid barrel was performed. 
Balloon dilation (CRE balloon, 12mm) was performed at the stenotic segment to 14mm.

Once patency improved to >90%, a new 16x50mm Dumon silicone stent was loaded and deployed covering the mid-to-distal trachea. Position confirmed with flexible scope. RUL patent. Stent stable.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Flexible bronchoscopy
2. Endobronchial ultrasound (linear) with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) of mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes

ANESTHESIA:
General anesthesia with 8.5 ETT, managed by anesthesia service

INDICATION:
Staging of PET-avid mediastinal/hilar adenopathy in a patient with RUL lung mass prior to lobectomy.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After informed consent, the patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite and placed under general anesthesia.
An 8.5 mm endotracheal tube was placed by anesthesia. A standard diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was
passed through the ETT. Full airway survey was performed. The trachea, carina, and right/left bronchial
tree were inspected. No endobronchial lesion was seen in the central airways.

The diagnostic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT.
Systematic nodal survey was performed.

Station 4R: Enlarged, 1.5 cm short axis, hypoechoic node with discrete borders. Four EBUS-TBNA passes
performed using a 22G needle. Adequate material obtained, on-site smears cellular.

Station 7: 1.2 cm hypoechoic subcarinal node. Four EBUS-TBNA passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE
showed lymphoid tissue; no complications.

Station 10R: Visualized only. Node measured approximately 6–7 mm. No clear malignant features.
NO sampling was performed at 10R; it was intentionally observed only.

No radial EBUS was used and no peripheral lung nodule sampling was attempted during this case.

The linear EBUS bronchoscope was then advanced through the ETT. A systematic nodal survey was performed.

Station 11R: 1.3 cm hypoechoic node. A radial EBUS miniprobe was briefly advanced into the node to better

DESCRIPTION:
After induction of general anesthesia, an 8.0 ETT was placed. A robotic bronchoscope was docked (Ion system).
Pre-procedure CT was loaded and registration performed with a registration error of 2.3 mm.

Using computer-assisted navigation, the scope was advanced to the LLL target. Radial EBUS probe demonstrated
a concentric hypoechoic lesion corresponding to the CT nodule. Through the robotic working channel, standard
forceps transbronchial lung biopsies were obtained from the LLL (5 passes) with fluoroscopic confirmation of
tool position. No pneumothorax seen on immediate fluoroscopy.

Following peripheral sampling, the robotic scope was removed and a linear EBUS scope was introduced through the ETT
for nodal staging.

SEDATION:

DESCRIPTION:
After informed consent, patient was placed supine and topical lidocaine applied to nasopharynx. Diagnostic
flexible bronchoscopy was performed via left naris. Vocal cords were mobile. Trachea and main bronchi without
endobronchial lesion.

Given CT suggestion of mediastinal nodes, attempt was made to pass the linear EBUS scope through the vocal cords.
However, despite additional topical anesthesia, the patient developed severe coughing and transient desaturation
to 84%. The EBUS scope could not be advanced safely beyond the glottis and NO nodal survey or TBNA passes were performed.

To at least obtain diagnostic material, the conventional bronchoscope was reintroduced and bronchoalveolar lavage
was performed in the right middle lobe (120 mL in, 70 mL out). Fluid sent for cytology, AFB smear/culture, and
fungal studies.

No biopsies (TBLB or TBNA) were performed and no EBUS images were obtained.

deployed in the right mainstem bronchus under bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. Post-deployment balloon dilation of the
stent was performed to ensure apposition to the airway wall.

All dilation occurred in the exact segment receiving the stent; no separate lobar or segmental dilation was performed outside

Acute moderate-to-massive hemoptysis in patient with known cavitary RUL lesion

ANESTHESIA:
Intubated in ICU by critical care team (8.0 ETT). Bronchoscopy performed under deep sedation on ventilator.

DESCRIPTION:
Flexible bronchoscope advanced through the ETT. Large amounts of fresh blood were suctioned from trachea and
right mainstem bronchus.

RIGHT LUNG:
RUL found to be the bleeding source with active oozing from posterior segment. No foreign body or tumor id[REDACTED].

HEMOSTATIC MEASURES:
- Iced saline lavage 50 mL aliquots x4 (200 mL total) to RUL
- Topical epinephrine 1:10,000, 10 mL instilled to RUL
- Tranexamic acid 500 mg in 50 mL NS instilled via bronchoscope
- No radial EBUS, navigation, or biopsies were performed

Following these measures, bleeding slowed from brisk to scant oozing. Airway was packed with small amounts of
suctioned clot but remained patent. No balloon tamponade was required.

LEFT LUNG:
Normal, no blood.

No transbronchial biopsies, brushings, or BAL were performed because priority was hemorrhage control.

COMPLICATIONS:
None beyond initial hemorrhage.

DISPOSITION:
Remain intubated in ICU, plan for IR bronchial artery embolization later this morning.

"Patient: [REDACTED] | 69F | MRN [REDACTED]
Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]
Attending: Jason Moore, MD

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS:
Recurrent malignant right pleural effusion with existing PleurX catheter

POST-OP DIAGNOSIS:
Same, status post chemical pleurodesis via existing tunneled pleural catheter

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Bedside chemical pleurodesis through existing tunneled pleural catheter (no new catheter placed)

ANESTHESIA:
Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine at catheter site and small dose IV fentanyl for comfort

DESCRIPTION:
Patient [REDACTED] metastatic lung cancer and an existing right-sided tunneled PleurX catheter was brought to
procedure area. Catheter site prepped and draped in sterile fashion.

Using sterile technique, 1 liter of serosanguinous pleural fluid was drained via the existing PleurX catheter.
After drainage, 4 g of sterile talc slurry in 100 mL normal saline was instilled through the same catheter
into the pleural space. The catheter was clamped and the patient rotated through several positions over
1 hour to distribute talc.

No new pleural catheter or chest tube was placed. The existing tunneled catheter was left in situ at the end
of the procedure for ongoing drainage as needed.

COMPLICATIONS:
None. No respiratory distress.

DISPOSITION:
Returned to oncology ward for observation.

"Patient: [REDACTED] | 58M | MRN [REDACTED]
Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]
Attending: Emily Rogers, MD

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS:
Small left pleural effusion of unclear etiology in patient with dyspnea

POST-OP DIAGNOSIS:
Same

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis, left

ANESTHESIA:
Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine at puncture site

DESCRIPTION:
Patient [REDACTED] upright. Bedside ultrasound demonstrated a small but definite left pleural effusion
with a safe pocket of approximately 2 cm depth at the posterior axillary line.

The skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. Using real-time ultrasound guidance, a
thoracentesis needle and catheter were advanced into the pleural space. Approximately 180 mL of straw-colored
fluid was removed before the patient developed pleuritic chest discomfort and coughing. The procedure was
terminated at that point, but adequate fluid was obtained for diagnostic testing.

No chest tube or tunneled catheter was placed. Post-procedure ultrasound showed residual trace fluid and no
evidence of pneumothorax.

Fluid was sent for cell count, protein, LDH, glucose, cytology, and culture.

COMPLICATIONS:
Mild chest discomfort and cough; no pneumothorax.

DISPOSITION:
Observed for 2 hours and discharged home.
