POST-OP DIAGNOSIS:
Same, status post rigid bronchoscopy with metallic stent placement

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
Rigid bronchoscopy with airway tumor debulking and balloon dilation, followed by right mainstem metallic stent placement

ANESTHESIA:
General anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy (anesthesia team)

DESCRIPTION:
Under general anesthesia, rigid bronchoscope introduced. A friable obstructing tumor was debulked with suction and forceps to
create a working channel. No separate excision code is being considered for this case.

A CRE balloon was then advanced to the right mainstem stenosis and inflated sequentially (10, 12, and 14 mm) across the same
segment that would receive the stent. After dilation improved luminal caliber, a covered metallic stent (14 mm x 50 mm) was
deployed in the right mainstem bronchus under bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. Post-deployment balloon dilation of the
stent was performed to ensure apposition to the airway wall.

All dilation occurred in the exact segment receiving the stent; no separate lobar or segmental dilation was performed outside
the stented region.

Stent position and patency were confirmed. No additional therapeutic bronchoscopy procedures were performed.
