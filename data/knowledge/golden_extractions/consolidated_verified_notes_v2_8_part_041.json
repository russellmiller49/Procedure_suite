    "note_text": "PATIENT: Williams, Janet S. || MRN: PFA-2025-447 || DOB: 05/19/1967\nDATE OF PROCEDURE: November 18, 2025\nINSTITUTION: Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH\nOPERATOR: Dr. Richard Patel, MD (Director, Thoracic Innovation Laboratory)\n\nPRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Left upper lobe peripheral nodule, 1.9 cm, proven squamous cell carcinoma\n\nPROCEDURE: Bronchoscopic Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) of pulmonary nodule - INVESTIGATIONAL\n\n*** INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) PROTOCOL #BR-PFA-2024-017 ***\n*** FDA-APPROVED CLINICAL TRIAL: PULSE-LUNG Phase II Study ***\n\nINFORMED CONSENT: Extended discussion with patient regarding investigational nature of pulsed field ablation for lung tumors. Patient enrolled in IRB-approved protocol. Detailed explanation of traditional ablation alternatives (microwave, RFA, cryo). Patient elected to participate after reviewing consent documents and meeting with research coordinator.\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nGeneral anesthesia. ENB performed with illumiSite platform. Target: LUL apicoposterior segment. Radial EBUS confirmation of lesion. Novel PFA catheter (FarapulsePulm system, 3.0mm diameter, bipolar electrode configuration) advanced through extended working channel. IMPORTANT: PFA uses rapid electrical pulses (1000-2000 V/cm) to create irreversible electroporation of cell membranes WITHOUT thermal damage - fundamentally different mechanism than traditional ablation modalities.\n\nABLATION PARAMETERS:\n- Pulse duration: 100 microseconds\n- Number of pulses: 80 per cycle  \n- Pulse frequency: 1 Hz\n- Number of treatment cycles: 3\n- Inter-cycle pause: 30 seconds\n- Voltage: 1500 V (adjusted based on impedance 80-120 ohms)\n- Energy delivery: Non-thermal (avoids bronchial damage, theoretically preserves adjacent structures)\n\nINTRAPROCEDURAL MONITORING:\nAdvanced impedance mapping performed throughout treatment showing successful energy delivery to entire tumor volume. Real-time EBUS post-ablation showed immediate increased echogenicity within tumor - consistent with cellular disruption from electroporation. No thermal injury pattern noted on adjacent bronchial walls (major advantage of PFA technology).\n\nOUTCOMES: \nSuccessfully completed per protocol. No arrhythmias noted (ECG monitoring showed stable rhythm - PFA timed to occur outside cardiac vulnerable period). Patient hemodynamically stable. Airways intact, no hemorrhage.\n\nNOVEL FINDINGS: \nPFA appears to cause more homogeneous ablation zone compared to thermal modalities. Real-time elastography (investigational feature) suggested complete tumor necrosis immediately post-procedure.\n\nDISPOSITION: Research protocol follow-up including CT at 48 hours, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks with volumetric analysis. Patient enrolled in long-term registry (5-year follow-up).\n\nResearch coordinator contacted. Data forms completed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nStudy PI: Richard Patel, MD\nProtocol: PULSE-LUNG-002",

Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURAL APPROACH:\nGiven the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.\n\nSedation Protocol:\nDeep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.\n\nTechnical Details:\nThe electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension\u2122) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning identified optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.\n\nThe extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.\n\nRadiation Exposure:\nTotal fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes\nDose-area product: 268 cGy\u00b7cm\u00b2\n(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)\n\nSampling Protocol:\nFollowing tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:\n- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens\n- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nSmall apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was identified on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.\n\nQUALITY METRICS:\n- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved\n- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)\n- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete\n- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology\n\nDISCUSSION:\nThis case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.",

Denies chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea. No PET scan performed due to renal dysfunction.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nProcedure: EBUS-TBNA\nSedation: Moderate (midazolam 2mg, fentanyl 50mcg) - limited doses due to CKD\nRamsay: 3\nVitals: Stable throughout, BP 128-142/75-82, SpO2 96-99% on RA\n\nFindings:\n- Station 2R: 8mm, sampled x3, ROSE shows metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with breast primary\n- Station 4R: 12mm, sampled x4, ROSE positive for metastatic carcinoma\n- Station 7: 9mm, sampled x3, ROSE positive for metastatic carcinoma\n\nSystematic evaluation performed. All accessible stations photographed.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n#1 Mediastinal lymphadenopathy - metastatic breast cancer confirmed\n#2 Breast cancer - recurrent disease, N2/N3 nodal involvement\n#3 CKD - tolerated sedation without issues\n\nPLAN:\n#1 Oncology referral for systemic therapy planning\n#2 Molecular profiling from station 4R sample\n#3 F/u renal function post-procedure\n\nComplications: None",
