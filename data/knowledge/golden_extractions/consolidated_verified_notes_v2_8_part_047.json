Continuous pulse oximetry, ECG, and noninvasive blood pressure monitoring. Supplemental O2 via nasal cannula.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter topical lidocaine to the oropharynx, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the mouth in the native airway. Vocal cords, trachea, and main bronchi were inspected to subsegmental level. No endobronchial mass or foreign body was seen. Copious mucopurulent secretions were present in the right lower lobe (RLL) bronchus; these were suctioned.\nBAL was performed in the RLL posterior segment with four 30 mL aliquots of sterile saline (total 120 mL), with approximately 60 mL of turbid return. Samples sent for cell count/differential, bacterial culture, fungal culture, AFB smear/culture, and cytology.\nNo biopsies, brushings, navigation, or EBUS were performed.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone. Oxygen saturation remained >92% throughout. No bleeding beyond scant blood-tinged secretions.\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE PLAN:\nObserve in PACU then discharge home if stable. Continue antibiotics. Follow up CT chest in 8 weeks or sooner if clinical status worsens.",

Under sterile conditions, the left posterior axillary line was marked. After local infiltration, a thoracentesis catheter was advanced into the pleural space with ultrasound guidance.\n\nA total of 1.2 L of clear yellow fluid was removed and sent for cell count, Gram stain and culture, pH, LDH, protein, and cytology. The catheter was then removed and a dressing applied.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone. No cough, chest pain, or air aspiration. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed interval decrease in effusion without pneumothorax.\n\nPLAN:\nResume antibiotics. Review pleural fluid studies to differentiate transudate vs exudate.
