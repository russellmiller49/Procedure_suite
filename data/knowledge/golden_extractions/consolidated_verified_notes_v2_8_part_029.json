All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.\n\nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there were no endobronchial lesions. There were thick non-purulent secretions in multiple airways which were suctioned.\n\nFollowing inspection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe with 180 cc instillation and 70 cc return. The SuperDimension navigational catheter was then inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using the navigational software, we were able to direct the catheter to within 1 cm of the left lingular lesion of interest. Radial ultrasound was then used to confirm location and a concentric view was seen indicating appropriate isolation of the lesion. TBNAs were performed under fluoroscopic observation and on ROSE numerous histiocytes and occasional giant cells were seen. Subsequently, further biopsies were performed with a triple needle brush and forceps biopsies under fluoroscopic observation. After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.\n\nComplications: No immediate complications\nEstimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc\n\nRecommendation:\n\u2022 CXR to rule out pneumothorax\n\u2022 Await pathology results\n\nThomas Wright, MD\nInterventional Pulmonary\n\n________________________________________",

Right-sided pleural effusion causing moderate dyspnea.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Informed consent obtained with discussion of increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia (platelets 68K) and coagulopathy (INR 1.7)\n- Timeout performed\n- Point-of-care ultrasound revealed right pleural effusion, maximum depth 6.5 cm\n- Labs reviewed: Platelets 68K, INR 1.7, Creatinine 1.2\n- Vital signs: BP 118/72, HR 76, SpO2 91% on 2L NC\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n- Patient positioned sitting, leaning forward\n- Right lateral chest, 7th intercosal space, posterior axillary line\n- Chlorhexidine skin prep\n- Local anesthesia: 12 mL of 1% lidocaine\n- Ultrasound-guided insertion of 8-French catheter system\n- Initial fluid: transudative appearance, clear yellow\n- Volume removed: 800 mL (stopped due to concern for re-expansion pulmonary edema)\n- Drainage rate kept slow (less than 1000 mL/hour)\n- Post-procedure ultrasound: no pneumothorax\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural fluid analysis (cell count, protein, LDH, albumin)\n- Pleural fluid culture\n\n**IMMEDIATE RESULTS:**\n- Appearance: Clear, yellow, transudative\n- Estimated protein <2.5 g/dL based on appearance\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Procedure well tolerated\n- No immediate complications\n- Vital signs: BP 122/74, HR 78, SpO2 94% on 2L NC\n- Patient reports significant improvement in breathing\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**ASSESSMENT:** Successful therapeutic thoracentesis of recurrent hepatic hydrothorax. Limited drainage to 800 mL to minimize risk of complications given underlying coagulopathy and hepatic disease.\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Continue diuretic optimization\n- Discuss with hepatology regarding TIPS evaluation\n- Consider repeat thoracentesis vs IPC if rapid reaccumulation\n- Sodium restriction and fluid management",

    "note_text": "Patient Name: James Patterson\nMRN: 4726193\nDate: May 29, 2019\n\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking\nProcedure Performed: Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation (CPT 31641)\n\nSurgeon: Patricia Lee, MD\nAssistant: Marcus Johnson, MD\nIndications: Tracheal obstruction\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics, the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords, there were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation, resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway. Additionally, there were multiple small polypoid (>50) lesions surrounding and distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1 cm proximal to the main carina. The right-sided and left-sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction.\n\nThe flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions. The lesions, once free from the wall, were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed, about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure, the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.\n\nOf note, we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect as the lesions regrew very quickly (<3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure. However, in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure, he expressed reluctance to have a stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation, and if I need to debulk again, I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.\n\nRecommendations:\n\u2022 Transfer patient back to ward room\n\u2022 Await final pathology results\n\u2022 Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy\n\nI, Patricia Lee, MD, was present and actively involved in all phases of the procedure.\n\n________________________________________",

All procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Supine with shoulder roll\nA rigid bronchoscope (14mm) was introduced via the mouth under direct visualization. High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) was utilized. A complete airway survey was performed.\nInitial Findings:\n\nTrachea: Patent, no lesions\nRight mainstem: Patent, mucosa normal\nLeft mainstem: 90% obstructed by friable, hemorrhagic endobronchial tumor starting 1cm distal to the carina and extending 3cm distally\n\nTherapeutic Interventions:\n1. Mechanical Debridement: The tumor was cored using the rigid bronchoscope with mechanical debridement. Multiple passes were required to remove bulk tumor. Estimated tumor volume removed: 15cc.\n2. Electrocautery: Residual tumor base was treated with electrocautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. Total treatment time: 3 minutes. FiO2 maintained at 40% during cautery.\n3.
