{"id": "1541787", "text": "BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE\n\nOn [REDACTED], Elizabeth Morgan, a 79-year-old male patient, presented to Baptist Medical Center [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Lisa Thompson, MD.\n\nThe clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 31.5 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the medial (B5) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 7.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.\n\nThe patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 57 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 4.\n\nFollowing the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:30.\n\nThe first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.\n\nAt station 4R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 23.5 millimeters in short axis and 32.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 14.3 millimeters in short axis and 14.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 11.1 millimeters in short axis and 12.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 20.1 millimeters in short axis and 33.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nFollowing completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.\n\nThe robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML medial (B5). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 5 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.\n\nThe procedure was completed at 10:15, for a total procedure time of 105 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.\n\nIn summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\nLisa Thompson, MD\nInterventional Pulmonology"}

Anesthesiology provided induction with propofol and rocuronium; patient mechanically ventilated throughout.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter pre-procedural verification and a time-out, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea and main carina were normal. The right bronchial tree was normal. On the left, there was subtle extrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea just above the carina and mild impression on the proximal left mainstem bronchus; mucosa was intact.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 22-gauge Wang TBNA needle was introduced via the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks (no EBUS available in this OR), the left lower paratracheal (4L) node was sampled by puncturing the medial wall of the distal trachea above the left mainstem origin. Three passes were performed with suction. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: Rapid on-site cytology was available. ROSE revealed lymphoid tissue with atypical epithelial cells; findings were suspicious for metastatic carcinoma and deemed adequate for diagnosis. Additional material was set aside for cell block and immunohistochemistry.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 4L conventional TBNA x3 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, and immunohistochemical staining.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding, airway compromise, or hemodynamic instability. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigational bronchoscopy was performed; this was purely a blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was extubated in the OR and transferred to PACU in stable condition. Final pathology will be correlated with prior breast cancer histology. If metastatic disease is confirmed, systemic therapy options will be discussed with oncology; if benign, further workup for granulomatous disease will be considered."}

{"id": "1925965_syn_8", "text": "Due to [REDACTED] 89% blockage in the right mainstem bronchus from metastatic cancer, we proceeded with stent placement. Under general anesthesia, we first dilated the narrowing with a balloon. We then deployed an 18x30mm covered Ultraflex SEMS. The stent expanded well, improving the airway patency significantly to a residual obstruction of 25%."}
