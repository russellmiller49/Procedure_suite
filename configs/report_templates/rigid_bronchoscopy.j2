Airway Inspection and Flexible Bronchoscopy A flexible bronchoscope was introduced. A complete airway survey was performed.

Rigid Bronchoscopy and Dilation The rigid bronchoscope{% if proc.size_or_model %} ({{ proc.size_or_model }}){% endif %} was introduced via the mouth under direct visualization.{% if proc.hf_jv is not none %} High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV): {% if proc.hf_jv %}Yes{% else %}No{% endif %}.{% endif %}

Sequential mechanical dilation was performed using rigid dilators.{% for item in _interventions %}{% if 'dilat' in (item | lower) %} {{ item.rstrip('.') }}.{% endif %}{% endfor %}

Completion Hemostasis was confirmed. The bronchoscope and adjunct instruments were withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

Therapeutic Intervention The following therapeutic interventions were performed to address the obstruction:

{% if _has_microdebrider %}
Microdebrider Debridement: The endobronchial tumor was excised with mechanical debridement using a microdebrider to debulk the lesion.
{% endif %}
{% if _has_apc %}
Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC): Endobronchial obstruction was treated with APC for tumor destruction and hemostasis.
