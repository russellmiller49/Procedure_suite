Chest Ultrasound Findings

Hemithorax: {{ proc.side | default("unspecified", true) | title }}

Findings: Pleural effusion identified and site marked for procedure.

Catheter Placement The {{ proc.side | default("unspecified", true) | lower }} chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia{% if proc.anesthesia_lidocaine_ml is not none %} with {{ proc.anesthesia_lidocaine_ml }} mL of 1% lidocaine{% else %} (Lidocaine 1%){% endif %} was infiltrated at the insertion site. A finder needle was used to enter the pleural space; pleural fluid was aspirated to confirm location. The needle was withdrawn and a guidewire was placed into the pleural space.

Two 5 mm skin incisions were made at the guidewire entry site, as well as 5-6 cm away. The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue. Serial dilation over the guidewire was then achieved. The introducer sheath was placed and the guidewire removed.

The{% if proc.drainage_device %} {{ proc.drainage_device }}{% else %} tunneled pleural catheter{% endif %} was then placed into the pleural space via the introducer sheath. The pleural entry site was closed with an absorbable suture. The catheter was secured to the skin using 2-0 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied.
