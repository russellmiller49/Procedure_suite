Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy — {{ _target }} Nodule A CT-based navigation plan was loaded and registration was completed using the {{ proc.navigation_system }} system. The navigation catheter{% if proc.navigation_catheter %} ({{ proc.navigation_catheter }}){% endif %} was advanced to the planned {{ _target }} target{% if proc.notes %} in the {{ proc.notes }} segment{% endif %}.

• Initial rEBUS assessment: The radial EBUS probe was advanced.{% if _img and ('cone' in _img or 'cbct' in _img) %} • Cone-beam CT imaging: A 3D spin was obtained to evaluate catheter-to-target alignment. • Confirmation: Cone-beam CT and radial EBUS confirmed the tool position within the lesion.{% endif %}
