Pigtail Catheter Placement (Modified for Drainage) The insertion site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.{% if proc.anesthesia_lidocaine_ml is not none %} Anesthesia: Lidocaine 1% ({{ proc.anesthesia_lidocaine_ml }} mL) was used for local anesthesia.{% else %} Anesthesia: Lidocaine 1% was used for local anesthesia.{% endif %} Entry Site: {{ proc.side | title }} hemithorax.

Findings and Technique: A {{ proc.size_fr }}Fr pigtail catheter was utilized. A pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trocar) was advanced over the guidewire.

Imaging: No imaging was utilized for this procedure (anatomic landmarks only).

Drainage:

{% if proc.fluid_removed_ml is not none %}Fluid Removed: {{ proc.fluid_removed_ml }} mL{% endif %}

{% if proc.fluid_appearance %}Appearance: {{ proc.fluid_appearance | title }}{% endif %}

Following adequate drainage, the pigtail catheter was removed. The site was dressed with occlusive gauze.
