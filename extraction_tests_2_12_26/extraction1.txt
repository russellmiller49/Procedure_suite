FINDINGS: Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All
questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional
protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure
assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was
performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper
airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the
mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal
mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was
normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree
was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were
normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was
then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the
mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic
hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis
diameter) were met in station 7, 11Rs, 11Ri lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle
aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the
station 7 Lymph node, followed by the 11Rs lymph node and then 11Ri a total of 5 biopsies
were performed in each station. ROSE evaluation yielded benign lymphocytes. The EBUS scope
ws then advanced into the right lower lobe where the primary mass could be visualized with
ultrasound. Further TBNA samples were obtained from the mass and followed by forceps
biopsies through the EBUS scope under direct ultrasound visulaization. ROSE was consistent
with malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS
bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood
and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was
subsequently removed.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None Page 2 / 2
COMPLICATIONS: None
IMPRESSION: Lung mass
RECOMMENDATIONS
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the postsurgical
monitoring unit.
- Discharge home when criteria met
- Will await final pathology results

🩺 Extraction Quality Report
Score: 70 / 100
Status: ⚠️ WARNING

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None explicitly in procedure data, though age_years: 2 in demographics is highly suspect for an adult procedure (EBUS/lung mass) and likely a parsing error, but I cannot verify without the full header.

Mismatch:

Outcome Mismatch: JSON outcome for lymph nodes is "benign" (Correct), but it missed the "malignancy" result found in the text for the lung mass.

Station Count: The JSON extracted 7, 11Rs, and 11Ri into evidence, but the derived CPT 31652 implies 1-2 stations. If the system collapses 11Rs/11Ri into a single "11R" bucket, the code is technically correct but loses granularity. If they are distinct targets, it should be 31653.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures (Critical):

Lung Mass Biopsy: The note explicitly states: "Further TBNA samples were obtained from the mass... followed by forceps biopsies through the EBUS scope." The pipeline completely missed the TBNA and Forceps Biopsy of the RLL mass.

Ultrasound of Mass: The note states "primary mass could be visualized with ultrasound".

Missed Details:

Pass Counts: Text explicitly says "a total of 5 biopsies were performed in each station." The JSON granular_data (implied by the schema) or node_events missed this count.

Target Location: "Right lower lobe" (RLL) mass is not captured.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

Under-coded: The system selected 31652 (EBUS 1-2 stations). It missed the therapeutic/biopsy codes for the mass.

Missing: 31628 (Transbronchial lung biopsy) or 31625 (Endobronchial biopsy) depending on strict anatomic interpretation of the mass location. Given "visualized with ultrasound" and "forceps biopsies through EBUS scope," 31628 is likely appropriate.

Missing: 31629 (TBNA of mass) - typically distinct from nodal TBNA.

Schema Compliance: The structure is valid, but the content is incomplete regarding the non-nodal interventions.

4. Corrected JSON Snippet (Procedures)
The missing mass sampling events must be added.
