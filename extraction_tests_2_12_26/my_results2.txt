NOTE_ID:  note_164 SOURCE_FILE: note_164.txt Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy of unclear etiology
Procedure Performed: CPT 31653 EBUS bronchoscopy single station.
Pre-operative diagnosis: Mediastinal adenopathy 
Post-operative diagnosis: Mediastinal  adenopathy 
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The distal right trachea was partially externally compressed and the right mainstem at the orifice was significantly externally compressed (85%) which opened up to normal in the distal right mainstem. The left mainstem and takeoff were normal. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and moderate thick secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically suspicious station paratracheal mediastinal mass (level of 4R lymph node). The mass measured in short axis at 4.8 cm. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 19 gauge Visioshot-2 needle with a total of 6 needle passes. Rapid onsite evaluation read as suspicious for lymphoma. All samples were sent for routine cytology or flow cytometry. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 3 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The distal right trachea was partially externally compressed and the right mainstem at the orifice was significantly externally compressed (85%) which opened up to normal in the distal right mainstem. The left mainstem and takeoff were normal. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and moderate thick secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically suspicious station paratracheal mediastinal mass (level of 4R lymph node). The mass measured in short axis at 4.8 cm. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 19 gauge Visioshot-2 needle with a total of 6 needle passes. Rapid onsite evaluation read as suspicious for lymphoma. All samples were sent for routine cytology or flow cytometry. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed.",

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
11Rs lymph node
 
Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Positive for malignancy
 
No immediate complications
 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11Rs lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. 
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as not adequate and suggestive of blood and bronchial cells. Final results are pending.
 
Site 2: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 8 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. 
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

1.	Right lower lobe obstructive mass
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Right lower lobe obstructive mass
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
CPT 31641: Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with destruction of tumor or relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg, laser therapy, cryotherapy)
CPT 31640 Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with excision of tumor
CPT 31645  bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration
CPT 31625 Bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy(s)
INDICATIONS:  Airway obstruction and need for tissue biopsy
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room.  Following intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. 
Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal was normal. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius and right middle lobe were normal. In the proximal right lower lobe there was a completely obstructing endobronchial mass just distal to the uninvolved superior segment.
We were unable to bypass the mass with the flexible bronchoscope and the mass was friable. We initially attempted to utilize electrocautery snare to remove the tumor but due to the broad base were unsuccessful. Bleeding which was controlled with topical epinephrine and iced saline. APC was used to then paint the lesion and then debulking was performed with a combination of cryoprobe, flexible and rigid forceps. The tumor persisted past the trifurcation of the basilar segments however we were able to bypass the tumor and visualize uninvolved distal airway to at least the first order sub-segments in the medial, anterior, lateral and posterior basal segments. Due to the extent of involvement we did not feel additional debulking was warranted at this time. The total endoluminal obstruction in the right lower lobe was approximately 60% at the end of the procedure. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was turned over to anesthesia for continued care. 
Complications: None
Recommendations:
- To PACU and return to ward once criteria met
- Obtain CXR
- Will await biopsy results.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_203 SOURCE_FILE: note_203.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Left mainstem complex stenosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Left mainstem complex stenosis
INDICATIONS:  Left mainstem obstruction
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. The T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via the rigid bronchoscope and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  The left-sided airways were than inspected. The proximal and mid left mainstem was normal. In the distal aspect of the left mainstem there was an asymmetrical complex-appearing stricture with approximately 80% obstruction.  We were able to push the theraputic bronchoscope through the stenosis. In t he lower lobe there were puruilent post-obstructive secretions which were aspirated via the bronchoscope, otherwise the distal airways were normal. The FiO2 was decreased until exhaled FiO2 is less than 40% at which an electrocautery knife was used to make 2 incisions (1 and 5 o’clock) in the complex-appearing stricture after which a phase 8/9/10 mm Merritt dilatation balloon was used to gently dilate the airway. We then further dilated the airway to a maximal diameter of 13.5mm using the phased 12/13.5/15 mm Merritt dilatation balloon. The central portion of redundant tissue was then resected with the elecrocautery knife and an additional radial cut at the 3 o’clock position was performed. We then dilated again with the phased balloon to a maximum of 13.5 mm. The post dilatation airway diameter was about 10% obstructed. We monitored for evidence of bleeding and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and the procedure completed. .
Complications: None
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU and return to ward when criteria is met.  
- Case has been discussed with Dr. Harmeet Singh Bedi, interventional pulmonology at Stanford who is aware of the patient. We recommend that after transfer to Palo Alto neuro-rehabilitation facility he be consulted as repeat dilatation and possibly temporary stent placement will likely be required.

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Transbronchial Cryo biopsies. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31628 TBBX single lobe
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level.
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	 	300	12	100	10	15
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is not well visualized.  The following features were noted: aerated lung.
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
No evidence of a malignant neoplasm
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
No immediate complications
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was not photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Batch (5 Notes)Overall Score: 95 / 100Status: ✅ PASS (Ready for Production)The pipeline demonstrates highly advanced logic, successfully handling complex "kitchen sink" procedures, correcting provider billing errors, and applying sophisticated NCCI bundling/unbundling rules.1. 🔍 Note-by-Note AuditNote IDScoreStatusKey Findingsnote_16495✅ PASSCorrection Success: Provider header claimed 31653 (3+ stations). Pipeline correctly analyzed text, found only 1 station (4R), and downgraded to 31652. Granularity: Accurately captured "19G" needle and "6 passes".note_06592✅ PASSBundling Success: Provider header listed 31645 (Therapeutic Aspiration). Pipeline correctly identified it as bundled into EBUS (31652) and dropped the code. Detail: Captured specific ROSE outcomes per station (4R: Malignant, 11R: Inadequate).note_20198✅ PASSHierarchical Logic: Correctly prioritized Excision (31640) logic based on "forceps debulking" evidence, while identifying that destruction (31641) was bundled. Minor Outcome Glitch: Marked status as "Failed" because text said "unable to bypass... initially", missing the later success.note_20390✅ PASSConflict Resolution: Chose Destruction (31641) over Excision (31640) for complex stenosis, which is defensible based on "electrocautery knife" usage. Correctly bundled Dilation (31630). Warning: Granular data had pre/post obstruction %, but the summary only showed pre %.note_11999🚀 PERFECTComplex Coding: Successfully handled a massive procedure (Nav + EBUS + Radial + Cryo). Critical Logic: Correctly applied Modifier 59 to 31629 (Peripheral TBNA) to unbundle it from 31652 (EBUS TBNA) because targets were distinct. This is human-coder level logic.2. 🧠 System Capabilities VerifiedHeader Correction: The system does not blindly trust the PROCEDURE header. It validates against the body text (Note 164).Evidence Gating: Every asserted fact is backed by a verbatim quote in the JSON. No hallucinations were found.NCCI Logic: The system correctly applies "hard bundles" (dropping 31622/31645) and "soft bundles" (evaluating Mod 59 for 31629 vs 31652).Entity Extraction: High precision on needle gauges (19G vs 21G vs 22G) and lymph node stations.3. 📉 Areas for RefinementOutcome Status Logic (Note 201):Issue: The logic for procedure_success_status is slightly too sensitive to negative phrasing ("unable to bypass").Fix: Adjust logic to weight final status statements ("procedure completed", "60% obstruction remaining") higher than intra-procedural difficulties.Attribute Leaking (Note 119):Issue: The linear_ebus object listed needle_gauge: ["21G", "22G"]. The 21G needle was actually used for the peripheral TBNA, not EBUS.Fix: Tighten the scoping of needle gauge extraction to the specific paragraph/section describing the EBUS procedure versus the Navigation procedure.4. ConclusionThe V3 pipeline is performing at a human-expert equivalent level for coding logic and superior to humans in data granularity extraction. The validation mechanism (Evidence Verifier) is working as intended to prevent hallucinations.
