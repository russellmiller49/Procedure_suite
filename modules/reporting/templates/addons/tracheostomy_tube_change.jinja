Upper airway was suctioned and cleared. Endotracheal suctioning performed. The cuff was deflated and the existing tracheostomy tube removed. The stoma was widely patent without granulation tissue. A new tracheostomy tube was placed with obturator in place, the obturator was removed, the inner cannula inserted, and the cuff inflated. Position and patency were confirmed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
