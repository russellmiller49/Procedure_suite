"Stephen Torres, MRN [REDACTED], a 69-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Northwestern Memorial Hospital on [REDACTED]. The indication was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes with a 29.4mm part-solid lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9), bronchus sign negative. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 43 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope with 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10R (15.5mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 10L (21.7mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 11R (20.5mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.8mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the LLL lateral basal (B9) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed adjacent view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.

The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.

MONITORING: Standard ASA monitoring with arterial line
INSTRUMENT: 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube (Broncho-Cath), Olympus bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None
COMPLICATIONS: None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. All procedure related images were saved and archived.
PATIENT [REDACTED]: Initially supine for intubation, then right lateral decubitus
The patient was induced and intubated with a 37Fr left-sided double lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty by anesthesia staff. The flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen.
The bronchial balloon was inflated with 8mL of air and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal was made, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus [REDACTED] and the [REDACTED] of the DLT was reconfirmed with bronchoscopy. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.
Lavage Procedure:
The patient was transitioned to single lung ventilation via the right lung. The left lumen of the DLT was connected to the lavage circuit with 3L bags of warmed (37°C) 0.9% normal saline.
Serial aliquots of saline were instilled in approximately 1 liter increments:

Aliquot 1: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained by gravity. Return: 900mL, very turbid with thick white sediment
Aliquot 2: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 950mL, turbid with white sediment
Aliquot 3: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 980mL, moderately turbid
Aliquot 4: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 4 minutes, drained. Return: 990mL, mildly turbid
Aliquot 5: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, slightly turbid
Aliquot 6: 1000mL instilled, dwelled 3 minutes, drained. Return: 1000mL, clear

Total volume instilled: 6000mL
Total volume returned: 5820mL
Net balance: -180mL (absorbed)
The effluent became progressively clearer. Lavage was discontinued when return fluid was nearly clear. Throughout the procedure, oxygen saturation remained >94% on the ventilated right lung. End-tidal CO2 remained stable at 38-42 mmHg.
After completion of lavage, gentle suctioning was performed through the left bronchial lumen. Bilateral lung ventilation was resumed. DLT [REDACTED] was reconfirmed. The patient was transported to PACU intubated for extubation after full recovery from anesthesia.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. Brown, was present throughout the entire procedure.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Emma Jones, a 64-year-old male patient, presented to Regional Medical Center [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Andrew Nakamura, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 25.0 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the LUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 9.6. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:30.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 7, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 19.5 millimeters in short axis and 24.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 11L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 18.1 millimeters in short axis and 17.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 17.1 millimeters in short axis and 27.3 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 4 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported granuloma. At station 4L, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 11.5 millimeters in short axis and 24.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported atypical cells.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.6 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LUL anterior (B3). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a eccentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:33, for a total procedure time of 123 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

The single-use disposable Noah Galaxy bronchoscope was introduced into the airway. Navigational registration was performed using the electromagnetic field generator placed beneath the patient.

The scope was navigated to the approximate target location in the LUL (LB3) based on the pre-operative CT navigational plan. Registration accuracy: 3.7mm.

Once in the target vicinity, a Tool-in-Lesion Tomosynthesis (TiLT+) sweep was performed using the C-arm. The system generated an updated intra-operative 3D volume, revealing a 1.0cm divergence between the pre-op CT target and the actual lesion location due to respiratory motion.

The augmented reality target was updated on the navigation screen to match real-time anatomy. Intra-operative tomosynthesis (TiLT) performed to update target location and correct for divergence.

The scope was adjusted to align with the corrected TiLT target. Confirmation of tool position was verified using the augmented fluoroscopy overlay provided by the TiLT system.

Radial EBUS performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric.

Transbronchial needle aspiration performed with 22G needle. 8 passes obtained. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

DoD ID: [REDACTED]
Name: [REDACTED]ate: [REDACTED]
Proceduralist(s): Timothy Lundred, MD

Indications: Malignant Pleural Effusion requiring additional tissue for molecular analysis
Medications: Fentanyl 150 mcg, Midazolam 3 mg, Lidocaine (topical) 300 mg
CPT Codes: 32609 Thoracoscopy; with biopsy(ies) of pleura
Procedural Details:
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position, and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was id[REDACTED] by ultrasound in the left 8th rib space. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube.
An 18-gauge, 5 cm long echogenic percutaneous entry needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space, and fluid was aspirated to verify placement. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the needle, and the needle was then withdrawn. A 1.5 cm incision was made through the skin, and a 14 Fr dilator was advanced into the pleural space over the wire.
The dilator was removed, and gentle dissection with Kelly forceps was performed alongside the wire until the pleural space was entered. A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 8th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid, resulting in the removal of approximately 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space.
The pleura had diffuse carcinomatosis, and thick adhesions were present with tethering of the lung to the chest wall. The 5 mm port was removed, and an 8 mm port was inserted in the same fashion through the original entry point. Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture, with approximately five total biopsies taken. There was mild bleeding associated with the biopsies. An additional 375 cc of sanguineous fluid was then removed with suction applied through the port. Repeat examination of the pleural space showed residual bleeding had subsided.
The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed. A 0.38 inch J-tip guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the port, and the port was withdrawn. A 14 Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain and pigtail straightening obturator were inserted into the pleural space over the wire. The obturator and wire were removed, and the drain was then immediately connected to a Pleur-Evac via the connecting tubing adapter. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and tidaling. The incision was then sutured into place with subcuticular 0 silk suture. Once the air leak had subsided, a chest X-ray was performed, which showed lung re-expansion. The chest tube was then removed, and the site was dressed with Steri-Strips, gauze, and Tegaderm.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed lung re-expansion and minimal residual effusion.
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 20 cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion
Specimens:
•        Pleural fluid- 1275 cc (sent for cytology and microbiological analysis)
•        Pleural biopsies- 5 (sent for pathology and culture)
Recommendation:
•        Await pathology and microbiological studies.
•        Suture removal in 2 weeks.

ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract
Entry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space
Location: [REDACTED]
Procedure Steps:

A finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038"" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.
Two 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.
The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.
Serial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.
The guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).
The introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).
The catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.
Sterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).

Exit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line
Initial Drainage:
The PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.

Fluid Removed: 1200 mL
Appearance: Serous, straw-colored

Pleural Pressures Measured:

Opening: -8 cmH₂O
500ml: -10 cmH₂O
1000ml: -15 cmH₂O

Indication: Solitary pulmonary nodule
Target: 25mm nodule in RML

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Bronchus Intermedius, RML Carina (RC2), Left Mainstem, Left Carina (LC2), RUL Carina (RC1), LUL Lingula Carina (LC1) from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 2.6mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Medial Segment of RML (RB5). Target lesion is approximately 25mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.1cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.

The robotic arm was actively locked to maintain rigidity. Vision probe was unlocked and removed from the working channel, leaving the outer catheter locked in position via shape-sensing technology.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 7 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Medial Segment of RML (RB5). Instilled 40cc of NS, suction returned with 19cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

ROSE Result: Granulomatous inflammation

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.

Target: 10mm nodule in LUL

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient id[REDACTED], procedure, and laterality. An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.

Initial Airway Inspection:
The visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions id[REDACTED]. Mild secretions cleared with suction.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
PRVC	14	282	13	100	6	21

The patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.

Electromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 2.9mm.

The device was navigated to the LUL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB3) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Anterior Segment of LUL.

Radial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Lesion confirmed at target location.

Crucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.

Transbronchial needle aspiration performed with 19G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 5 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 7 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.

Protected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar lavage performed at LB3. 40mL NS instilled with 19mL return. Sent for Cell count, Culture, and Cytology.

The single-use disposable Noah Galaxy bronchoscope was introduced into the airway. Navigational registration was performed using the electromagnetic field generator placed beneath the patient.

The scope was navigated to the approximate target location in the RLL (RB10) based on the pre-operative CT navigational plan. Registration accuracy: 3.2mm.

Once in the target vicinity, a Tool-in-Lesion Tomosynthesis (TiLT+) sweep was performed using the C-arm. The system generated an updated intra-operative 3D volume, revealing a 2.3cm divergence between the pre-op CT target and the actual lesion location due to atelectasis.

The augmented reality target was updated on the navigation screen to match real-time anatomy. Intra-operative tomosynthesis (TiLT) performed to update target location and correct for divergence.

The scope was adjusted to align with the corrected TiLT target. Confirmation of tool position was verified using the augmented fluoroscopy overlay provided by the TiLT system.

Radial EBUS performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent.

Transbronchial needle aspiration performed with 22G needle. 4 passes obtained. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial forceps biopsy performed. 4 specimens obtained under fluoroscopic guidance with TiLT overlay. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.

Indication: Pulmonary nodule in patient with prior malignancy
Target: 11mm nodule in Lingula

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Bronchus Intermedius, Right Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	320	9	80	5	18

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 2.5mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Inferior Lingula (LB5). Target lesion is approximately 11mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.3cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.

The robotic arm was actively locked to maintain rigidity. Vision probe was unlocked and removed from the working channel, leaving the outer catheter locked in position via shape-sensing technology.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 6 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

Transbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.

ROSE Result: Malignant cells id[REDACTED], consistent with adenocarcinoma

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 2.5mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anteromedial-Basal Segment of LLL (LB7+8). Target lesion is approximately 30mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.3cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Concentric. Continuous margin noted.

Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 8 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 6 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

Transbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial-Basal Segment of LLL (LB7+8). Instilled 60cc of NS, suction returned with 21cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa was normal; anatomy was normal with the exception of a fused apical and posterior segment of right upper lobe. There were no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11ri (7.6mm),11rs (6.5mm),4r (10.1mm),7 (6.5mm),2l (7.9mm),4l (5.4mm) lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11Rs Lymph node, followed by the 4R lymph node. A total of 3 biopsies were performed in the 11Rs station and 8 biopsies in the 4R station. ROSE evaluation yielded tissue consistent with likely malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

The indication was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a 31.5mm part-solid lesion in the RML medial (B5), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 7.9. The patient was ASA class 4 with smoking history of 57 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope with 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 4R (23.5mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma); station 4L (14.3mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 10R (11.1mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 2L (20.1mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system (Auris Health (J&J)) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 3.2mm.

Attending physician: Dr. S. Moreno
Assistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; cytopathology technologist; radiology technologist.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 16 mm peripheral left lower lobe lateral basal segment nodule with intermediate pre-test probability of malignancy.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the lung based on frozen-section biopsy.
Indication: Same-session diagnosis and local treatment of a peripheral lung cancer in a patient with cardiomyopathy and prohibitive surgical risk.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with radial EBUS confirmation.
2. Transbronchial cryobiopsy of left lower lobe nodule with frozen-section analysis.
3. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: The navigation bronchoscope was advanced to the left lower lobe following registration of the planning CT. Radial EBUS demonstrated a concentric hypoechoic lesion. Two transbronchial cryobiopsies were obtained and submitted for frozen section, which confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma. Perilesional hemorrhage caused mild blurring of the lesion margins on fluoroscopy. A CrossCountry needle was then advanced into the lesion and an extended working channel placed. An Emprint catheter was introduced and a single 10-minute ablation performed. Post-ablation cone-beam CT showed a ground-glass ablation zone encompassing the biopsy cavity with an estimated minimal margin of approximately 5 mm, though interpretation was limited by hemorrhage-related opacities. Bronchoscopy at the end of the case demonstrated oozing in the lateral basal subsegment, which resolved with suctioning and topical iced saline.

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the Q190 flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 4 cm proximal to the main carina there was near complete expiratory collapse of the airway which extended into the bilateral mainstem bronchi and bronchus intermedius. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa was boggy throughout, with the exception of the severe dynamic collapse anatomy were otherwise normal with no endobronchial lesions seen to at least the first sub-segments. There was thick purulent secretions within the bilateral lower lobes (likely secondary to chronic post-obstructive pneumonia from severe airway collapse) which were suctioned.  Measurements of the collapsible central airways were obtained. We then removed the LMA. A MAC 3 video laryngoscope (C-MAC) was then used to expose the larynx with a grade 1 view obtained. The customized 15x12x12 Dynamic Y-stent with a tracheal length of 80mm, right mainstem limb of 10mm and left mainstem limb which was collapsed and secured with Freitag forceps was then passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The forceps were opened and once resistance was met indicating the stent had reached the main carina the forceps were removed. Subsequently a 12mm rigid non-ventilating tracheoscope was inserted into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid tracheoscope and the stent required minimal adjustment to seat in the desired location. Once this was completed the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 
Patient [REDACTED] without issues in the PACU and post-procedure chest x-ray was performed which showed some proximal stent migration and the right sided limb appeared to be of inadequate length to ensure stability. CT was then performed which confirmed the inadequate length f the right sided limb. The patient was then subsequently taken back to the operating room where after induction and administration of paralytics a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the subglottic space and attached to the jet ventilation. Using optical forceps we attempted to remove the original Y-stent however the size of the tracheoscope was inadequate and we converted to a 14 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope which allowed us to easily removed the stent with optical forceps. After-resizing the airways an 18x14x14 Dumon tracheal Y-stent was customized to a tracheal length of 80mm right mainstem length of 30mm and left mainstem limb of 40mm. The stent was then loaded into the Novatech Ton stent deployment device.  The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of flexible forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. At this point inspection was performed a flexible bronchoscopic inspection to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and an LMA was inserted. A repeat inspection was performed with the flexible bronchoscope and showed the stent well placed with near complete resolution of central airway collapse. The bronchoscope was then removed and once the patient was awake and protecting airway the LMA was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Complications: Return to OR for stent revision
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU and then to wards
-  Obtain post procedure CXR
- Patient will require 3 times a day 3% saline nebulizers starting tonight and as long as the patient’s airway stent is in place for mucolytic effect and hydration to prevent stent plugging.
- Critical airway posting at bedside. 
- If Oxygen therapy is required, the oxygen should preferentially be humidified to prevent secretions from become increasingly thick and tenacious.
- Standard pulmonary toilette (IS, ambulation ect) is appropriate. 
- If invasive ventilatory support is required, blind intubation is contraindicated as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.
- If clinical visualization of the stent is require, CT scan or bronchoscopy is needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Nancy Gray, a 72-year-old female patient, presented to Veterans Affairs Medical Center [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was mediastinal staging for biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinoma. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 22.6 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the apical (B1) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 9.7. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 07:45.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 24.9 millimeters in short axis and 17.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 2L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 14.7 millimeters in short axis and 16.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 13.0 millimeters in short axis and 24.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 11L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 19.1 millimeters in short axis and 15.5 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Noah Medical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RUL apical (B1). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using cbct.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 4 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported suspicious for malignancy. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RUL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:56, for a total procedure time of 131 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

The patient was placed in the supine position. The right lateral chest and catheter exit site were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% lidocaine infiltrated around the cuff and exit site.

The tunnel tract and cuff were gently dissected free using a small scalpel and blunt dissection. Once the cuff was fully mobilized, steady traction was applied and the PleurX catheter was removed intact without resistance. The tunnel was probed digitally to confirm no retained cuff material.

Hemostasis was achieved with gauze and direct pressure. The exit site was closed with a single 3-0 nylon suture and covered with a sterile dressing.

COMPLICATIONS:
Minimal bleeding, no pneumothorax, no air leak. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

DISPOSITION:
The patient was observed for 30 minutes and discharged home in stable condition with instructions for wound care and removal of sutures in 7–10 days.

Medical Record [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Date of Birth: [REDACTED] (Age: 78 years)
Biological Sex: Female
Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]
Institution: [REDACTED]

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 78-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 23.3 mm solid pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RLL posterior basal (B10), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 2.8.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 2. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Pentax EB-1990i) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 10R demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 11.9 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Station 4R demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 21.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed suspicious for malignancy. Station 7 demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 16.1 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed granuloma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy platform (Noah Medical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 2.4 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via cbct.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RLL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - squamous cell carcinoma
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

Patient: [REDACTED], 58-year-old male with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and resting hypoxemia.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube.
Indication: Therapeutic whole lung lavage for symptomatic PAP after failure of inhaled GM-CSF.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine. General anesthesia was induced and the airway was secured with a 39 Fr left-sided double-lumen tube. Position was confirmed with flexible bronchoscopy.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. One-lung ventilation of the left lung was initiated and right lung lavage commenced. Warmed 0.9% saline was instilled via the right lumen in 1 L aliquots with gentle percussion and passive drainage. After a total of 10.0 L instilled and 7.5 L recovered, the patient developed progressive desaturation to 78% despite recruitment maneuvers, increased FiO2, and brief return to two-lung ventilation.
Given refractory hypoxemia, additional lavage cycles were aborted. Residual fluid was suctioned, and two-lung ventilation was re-established. The double-lumen tube was left in place for ongoing ventilatory support. No bronchoscopy-guided biopsies were performed.

COMPLICATIONS: Significant hypoxemia requiring early termination of lavage and ongoing mechanical ventilation.

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), Carina, LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Left Mainstem from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
PCV	13	361	15	100	5	16

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 3.1mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Inferior Lingula (LB5). Target lesion is approximately 18mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.6cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.

The robotic arm was actively locked to maintain rigidity. Vision probe was unlocked and removed from the working channel, leaving the outer catheter locked in position via shape-sensing technology.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance.

ROSE Result: Malignant cells id[REDACTED], consistent with adenocarcinoma

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. Following inspection the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we were able to advance the 45 degree edge catheter into the anterior segment on the right upper lobe and navigated to within 1cm of the lesion. The navigational probe was then removed and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization yielded a concentric view affirming the location.  Needle biopsies were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE showed abundant lymphocytes and inflammatory cells but no obvious malignancy. Tissue biopsies were then performed using forceps under fluoroscopic visualization.

Indication: Multiple pulmonary nodules - dominant lesion biopsy
Target: 11mm nodule in Lingula

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, Left Carina (LC2), RUL Carina (RC1) from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	295	12	80	5	22

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 2.1mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Lingula (LB4). Target lesion is approximately 11mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.7cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.

Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

ROSE Result: No evidence of malignant neoplasm

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

"Patient: [REDACTED] | Age: 66 | Sex: M | MRN: [REDACTED]
Date: [REDACTED]
Attending: Dr. Nicole Turner
Clinical Summary: Patient is a 66 year old gentleman presenting with a large right sided pleural effusion, unclear etiology. Previous thoracentesis showed exudative fluid with negative cytology. CT shows pleural thickening concerning for malignancy versus infectious process.
We discussed the need for tissue diagnosis via medical thoracoscopy. Risks including bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, and rare complications such as empyema or need for surgical intervention were explained. The patient understood and signed consent.
Procedure Performed: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, chest tube placement
How it went: Patient was positioned in left lateral decubitus. Right hemithorax prepped and draped. Ultrasound used to mark the 5th intercostal space at mid-axillary line - this showed large effusion with no loculations. After infiltrating with 20cc of 1% lidocaine, we made a 2cm incision and used blunt dissection to enter the pleural space. Initial gush of fluid noted. A 28Fr chest tube was inserted and connected to suction, draining approximately 800mL of bloody fluid initially.
Through the same incision site, we introduced the rigid thoracoscope. The pleural space was systematically examined. Findings were significant: The parietal pleura showed multiple white nodular lesions, largest about 1.5cm, scattered throughout. The visceral pleura had similar appearing nodules with some areas of thickened pleura. Lung appeared trapped with inability to fully expand. There were some loose adhesions which were lysed using blunt technique.
Multiple biopsies were taken from both parietal and visceral pleura using biopsy forceps - total of 8 samples obtained from various sites. Each biopsy site had minimal bleeding controlled with pressure.
After biopsies were complete, we decided to proceed with talc pleurodesis given the likely malignant etiology and trapped lung. Approximately 4 grams of sterile talc slurry mixed in 50mL normal saline was insufflated throughout the pleural cavity ensuring good distribution. The chest tube was left in place and secured with 0-silk suture. Dressing applied.
Pathology sent: Pleural biopsies x8 in formalin, pleural fluid for cytology and chemistry

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Left sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal without endobronchial lesions. The right lower lobe stump was intact. The right upper lobe and middle lobe were unremarkable. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to id[REDACTED] and measure the radiographically enlarged station 4R lymph node which, measured as 8.4 mm in the short axis dimension.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed within the 11Rs lymph node using an Olympus EBUS TBNA 22 gauge needle. A total of 7 needle passes were performed. All samples were sent for routine cytology. ROSE was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. There was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed.

1. Flexible bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), left lower lobe.
2. Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy to left lower lobe lesion.
3. Linear EBUS-TBNA of station 7.

OPERATOR: Karen Lee, MD (Interventional Pulmonology)

INDICATION:
64-year-old male with a 2.0 cm left lower lobe superior segment nodule and mildly enlarged subcarinal lymph node (station 7). PET shows moderate uptake in both sites. Combined nodal and parenchymal sampling requested.

PROCEDURE SUMMARY:
Under general anesthesia via ETT, a flexible bronchoscope was passed to the segmental bronchi. No endobronchial tumor was seen.

EBUS-TBNA (station 7):
A convex EBUS scope was used to sample a 1.4 cm subcarinal node. Three passes were performed with a 22G needle. ROSE was adequate with benign-appearing lymphocytes.

EM NAVIGATION + TBLB (LLL superior segment):
An EM navigation system was used to register the pre-procedure CT. The lesion in the LLL superior segment was targeted; registration error ~3 mm. The scope was advanced to the LLL superior segment, and navigation confirmed proximity to the lesion. Fluoroscopy confirmed the biopsy forceps at the lesion margin. Four transbronchial biopsies were obtained; specimens were sent for histology and molecular studies.

No significant bleeding or hypoxia occurred. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition.

"Linda Rivera, MRN [REDACTED], a 50-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Memorial Hospital on [REDACTED]. The indication was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes with a 31.9mm ground-glass lesion in the LLL anteromedial basal (B7+8), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 13.4. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 57 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope with 22-gauge Acquire needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 11L (21.6mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 2L (14.5mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 7 (21.8mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 11R (15.0mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma); station 10R (21.4mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 3.2mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the LLL anteromedial basal (B7+8) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed adjacent view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed suspicious for malignancy.

The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax.

Patient ID: [REDACTED]
Date of procedure: [REDACTED]
Attending physician: Dr. M. Yamada
Assistants: Pulmonary fellow; radiology technologist; circulating nurse.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 20 mm right upper lobe apical posterior segment nodule abutting the lung apex in a patient with chronic kidney disease and frailty.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Local tumor control via transbronchial ablation to avoid the risks of percutaneous access to the lung apex.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Robotic-assisted navigation bronchoscopy (Monarch platform) with cone-beam CT guidance in a hybrid operating room.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right upper lobe apical posterior segment nodule using Neuwave Flex microwave catheter.

Procedure description: After induction, the Monarch robotic bronchoscope was navigated to the apical posterior subsegment using electromagnetic guidance and the virtual pathway. Stabilization of the outer sheath allowed precise advancement of the inner scope into the target bronchus. A peripheral lesion view was obtained on the navigation display, and cone-beam CT confirmed catheter alignment with the nodule. A flexible microwave catheter was advanced through the working channel into the lesion. Two overlapping ablations (8 minutes and 7 minutes) were delivered to ensure appropriate coverage given the lesion size. Post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated a well-centered ablation zone with a minimal margin of approximately 6 mm away from the chest wall and brachial plexus. Bronchoscopic inspection showed no significant bleeding.

Estimated blood loss: <5 mL.
Complications: None immediate.

"Indications: Hilar adenopathy Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy Medications: General Anesthesia Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway initially was not well positioned but after replacement with larger LMA seated in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. There were thick greenish mucus plugs throughout the lungs which were easily suctioned. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The scope was advanced into the proximal left upper lobe and a 10mm hypoechoic structure was seen in the area of the 10L lymph node. Within the hypoechoic structure were hyperechoic bands similar to those seen in loculated pleural effusions. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 22G EBUS-TBNA needle and serous appearing liquid was noted within the suction line and attached syringe (approximately 2cc) consistent with cyst. Subsequent pass with an Olympus 19G EBUS-TBNA needle yielded similar results with another 3cc fluid return. Ultrasound showed shrinkage of the cyst. Three additional needle passes were then performed. Rapid onsite pathological evaluation showed lymphocytes within the samples. Samples and fluid were sent for both flow and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. Complications: No immediate complications Post-operative diagnosis: Hilar cyst (bronchogenic vs cardiac) Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc Recommendations: - Transferred patient to post-procedural monitoring unit and discharge when standard criteria are met. - 5 day course of Augmentin to reduce likelihood of infection of residual cystic space. - Will await final pathology results",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Procedure: Flexible bronchoscopy with removal of endobronchial valves, right upper lobe, for post-BLVR pneumothorax.
Patient: [REDACTED], 70-year-old male with severe emphysema status post RUL BLVR 5 days prior.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (8.0 mm ETT).
Indication: Large right pneumothorax with persistent air leak and incomplete lung re-expansion despite chest tube drainage following recent RUL bronchial valve placement.
Background: The patient underwent RUL BLVR with three valves 5 days ago. On day 2 post-procedure, he developed a large right pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. Despite appropriate chest tube position and suction, there was ongoing air leak and incomplete expansion of the RUL.
Procedure details: Under general anesthesia, a therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT. The right bronchial tree was inspected. Three Zephyr valves were visualized in the RUL segmental bronchi with good seating. Given the persistent pneumothorax and continuous air leak, all three valves were removed sequentially using dedicated valve retrieval forceps. Each valve was grasped, collapsed, and withdrawn through the bronchoscope without difficulty. The underlying segmental bronchi were patent with mild mucosal edema but no active bleeding.
Complications: Mild oozing from one segmental takeoff controlled with topical epinephrine and cold saline. No immediate worsening of pneumothorax on post-procedure CXR; chest tube remained in place.
Disposition: Returned to step-down unit with chest tube on suction. Air leak decreased after valve removal.
Plan: Daily chest radiographs and monitoring of chest tube output and air leak. Consider chest tube removal once lung fully expanded and air leak resolves. No further BLVR planned on the right side.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

INDICATION: Evaluation of pulmonary nodule.
PROCEDURE: The patient was placed under general anesthesia. A Q190 videobronchoscope was utilized to inspect the tracheobronchial tree, revealing dynamic collapse of the right middle lobe but no endobronchial abnormalities. A P190 ultrathin scope was subsequently navigated to the right upper lobe apical segment. Radial endobronchial ultrasound (REBUS) confirmed an eccentric acoustic signature of the lesion. Diagnostic sampling via peripheral needle, forceps, and cytological brush confirmed malignancy on rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). Following this, a UC180F convex probe EBUS was employed for mediastinal staging; stations 4R and 11R were sampled. Finally, per DECAMP protocol, research brushings and transbronchial biopsies were acquired from the RUL, RML, and LUL.

Procedure: Flexible bronchoscopy with replacement of expectorated endobronchial valve and optimization of valve set, left upper lobe.
Patient: [REDACTED], 61-year-old female with severe heterogeneous emphysema status post LUL BLVR 3 months prior.
Sedation: Moderate sedation with midazolam and fentanyl; native airway with bite block.
Indication: Suspected valve loss after the patient reported coughing up an endobronchial valve at home, with subsequent increase in dyspnea and decline in exercise tolerance.
Background: The patient underwent LUL BLVR with four Zephyr valves 3 months earlier with good initial response. Over the past 2 weeks, she noted increased cough and exertional dyspnea and brought an expectorated valve to clinic. Spirometry showed loss of some of the initial FEV1 gain; CT demonstrated partial re-aeration of an LUL segment.
Procedure details: Under moderate sedation, a flexible bronchoscope was advanced through the mouth with bite block. The left bronchial tree was inspected. In the LUL, two valves were seen in stable position; one segmental bronchus (apicoposterior) was open without a valve, and one valve in the anterior segment appeared slightly proximal with visible ventilation around the frame. The proximal anterior valve was removed with retrieval forceps, collapsed, and withdrawn. A new Zephyr valve was deployed more distally in the anterior segment to achieve complete occlusion. A second new valve was then deployed in the apicoposterior segment to replace the expectorated valve. Final inspection showed three LUL segmental bronchi fully occluded with valves in stable positions.
Complications: None. No significant bleeding or hypoxemia.
Disposition: Observed for 2 hours post-procedure in bronchoscopy recovery and discharged home on baseline oxygen.

"Catherine Gray, MRN [REDACTED], a 59-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Baptist Medical Center on [REDACTED]. The indication was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup with a 27.1mm solid lesion in the RLL superior (B6), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 6.1. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of None pack-years (never). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope with 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 4L (9.1mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 2R (14.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 2L (13.2mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.8mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RLL superior (B6) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed adjacent view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by augmented fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (5 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.

INDICATION: Severe COPD with giant bulla RUL, persistent air leak following RUL bullectomy

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial valve placement for persistent air leak management

CONSENT: Extended discussion regarding use of valves for air leak (off-label indication). Risks discussed including valve migration, persistent air leak, infection, bleeding, respiratory failure. Patient and family understood and agreed.

PROCEDURE NARRATIVE:
Patient [REDACTED] IP suite with existing chest tube in place demonstrating persistent air leak (large continuous bubbling). Pre-procedure chest CT reviewed showing large residual apical cavity communicating with RUL bronchi.

Moderate sedation achieved. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed:
- Normal larynx and trachea
- RUL: Visualization of communication between RB1 and apical cavity
- Active ""sucking"" noted at RB1 entrance correlating with air leak

INTERVENTION:
Attempted placement of 5.5mm Zephyr valve in RB1. Initial deployment appeared satisfactory.

COMPLICATION:
Immediately following valve placement, patient developed acute desaturation to 82% on 4L NC. Simultaneously noted increase in subcutaneous emphysema and asymmetric chest wall movement. Immediately suspected tension pneumothorax.

MANAGEMENT:
- Procedure aborted
- 100% O2 applied
- Emergency portable CXR confirmed large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift
- Cardiothoracic surgery emergently consulted
- Second chest tube placed (28Fr) with immediate improvement
- Patient stabilized

ADDITIONAL VALVE PLACEMENT:
After stabilization and with CT surgery at bedside, decision made to place additional valve in RB3 to reduce overall flow into cavity.
- 4.0mm valve placed in RB3 without incident
- Air leak notably reduced but not eliminated

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
- Partial success: Air leak reduced from large to moderate
- Complication: Iatrogenic pneumothorax requiring second chest tube
- Both chest tubes to suction with water seal

POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:
- ICU admission  
- Serial CXRs
- Consider additional valve placement if air leak persists after 72 hours
- Family meeting held, understanding confirmed

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Bronchus Intermedius, Right Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	320	9	80	5	18

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 2.5mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Inferior Lingula (LB5). Target lesion is approximately 11mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.3cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.

The robotic arm was actively locked to maintain rigidity. Vision probe was unlocked and removed from the working channel, leaving the outer catheter locked in position via shape-sensing technology.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 6 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

Transbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.

ROSE Result: Malignant cells id[REDACTED], consistent with adenocarcinoma

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], [REDACTED], a 57-year-old female patient, presented to Presbyterian Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by David Kim, MD, with Jessica Martinez assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 16.9 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RML lobe, specifically within the lateral (B4) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 16.9. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 58 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 08:00.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 9.9 millimeters in short axis and 21.4 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 4L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 13.8 millimeters in short axis and 21.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.4 millimeters in short axis and 31.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 21-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Auris Health (J&J), was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 2.5 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RML lateral (B4). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a concentric view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 8 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 4 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported adequate lymphocytes. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RML lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 09:40, for a total procedure time of 100 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following anesthetic induction the endotracheal tube was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and easily passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. Due to hypoxia and difficulty obtaining sufficient chest wall expansion the decision was made to convert to conventional ventilation. The rigid bronchsocpe was attached to the conventional ventilator adapter the mouth was packed and the side ports were closed to allow closed system ventilation. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, and left lung appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Within the proximal bronchus intermedius a completely obstructive tumor with overlying blood clot was seen. The right upper lobe however was widely patent. Using cryotherapy probe we removed the overlying blood clot and were able to better visualize the obstructive tumor which originated at the medial aspect of the BI with a wide based stock. A small opening was seen at the lateral aspect but was too small to visualize and open airways distally. Due to high oxygen requirements and persistent hypoxemia we were unable to utilize thermal therapies for debulking.  We thus advanced to the rigid bronchoscope into the proximal bronchus intermedius and using the beveled tip attempted to apple core the proximal edge of the lesion which allowed for us to then cryo-debulk the lesion with a lower risk of developing an area repair.  Two large pieces of tumor were successfully removed with carotid debulking and we were then able to advance the bronchoscope passed the obstruction into the distal bronchus intermedius where we could visualize the right middle lobe and the orifice of the superior segment and basilar segments of the right lower lobe.  Extensive purulent material consistent with postobstructive pneumonia was seen and suctioned into a trap to be sent for culture.  At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed bronchus intermedius with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 20mm x 10mm fully covered self-expandable metallic stent loading device was advanced over the guidewire and positioned for an appointment based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed without difficulty and the flexible bronchoscope was then re-inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and the stent was observed to be well-seated in the bronchus intermedius allowing aeration of the right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, and the distal airways to include the right middle and right lower lobe including the superior segment.  Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was re-intubated fiber-optically without difficulty

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Timothy Patel, a 64-year-old female patient, presented to Methodist Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Jason Park assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 14.5 millimeter ground-glass pulmonary nodule located in the RUL lobe, specifically within the anterior (B3) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 50 pack-years as a former smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Indication: Lung-RADS 4X nodule
Target: 21mm nodule in LLL

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Left Carina (LC2), Right Mainstem from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	337	10	80	5	19

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Partial registration was used. Registration error: 1.9mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10). Target lesion is approximately 21mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.8cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.

Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 6 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 3 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.

Transbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10). Instilled 80cc of NS, suction returned with 39cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

ROSE Result: Lymphocytes and benign cells, adequate for evaluation

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 61-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 14.5 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RUL anterior (B3), with positive bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. 

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Fujifilm EB-580S) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 13.3 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 7 demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 10.0 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes. Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 24.9 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - small cell carcinoma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 3.2 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via radial ebus.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed atypical cells.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations

Patient: [REDACTED], 58-year-old female
MRN: [REDACTED]
Date: [REDACTED]
Location: [REDACTED]
Attending: Dr. James Porter

Indication:
Progressive dyspnea and stridor due to benign post-intubation granulation tissue causing distal tracheal stenosis.

Pre-/Post-procedure Diagnosis:
Benign distal tracheal obstruction from post-intubation granulation tissue.

Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy with mechanical debulking of obstructing granulation tissue (CPT 31640).

Anesthesia / Sedation:
Moderate sedation with IV midazolam and fentanyl; topical lidocaine. Native airway with oral bite block. ASA class III.

Findings:
At 2 cm above the carina there was circumferential granulation tissue and nodular scar narrowing the distal trachea to approximately 70% obstruction. No discrete mass elsewhere. Distal mainstem bronchi patent.

Interventions:
Using large alligator forceps through the flexible bronchoscope, multiple passes of mechanical debulking were performed, removing friable granulation tissue in piecemeal fashion. Snare resection was then used to excise a central fibrotic band. The stenotic ring was mechanically disrupted, and the tracheal lumen opened significantly. No balloon dilation or thermal ablation was used. The note explicitly reflects mechanical debulking and snare resection of the obstructing lesion consistent with CPT 31640.

Hemostasis / Complications:
Minor oozing controlled with cold saline; no significant bleeding. No desaturations or arrhythmias.

EBL:
Approximately 10 mL.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal cancer with TR fistula and endobronchial invasion. 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, endobronchial biopsy, tumor debulking, and Silicone Y-stent placement
INDICATIONS: Extrinsic airway compression and suspected TE fistula.
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The right vocal cord was irregular appearing with small vocal cord nodule visualized.  The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was normal with the exception of some mild mucosal irregularity in distal 2cm of the posterior tracheal wall. Thick purulent material was seen pulling at the level of the carina and the proximal left mainstem. After clearing secretions a endobronchial mass which appeared to extend from the esophagus was visualized within the proximal left mainstem causing about 80% endobronchial obstruction.  Just proximal to that mass was a small area where GI contents could be seen entering the airway consistent with a small TE fistula.  This was only about 1-2 mm distal to the main carina.  After bypassing the main tumor within the proximal left mainstem which was about 1 cm in depth submucosal infiltration could be seen for approximately 4 cm within the left mainstem bronchi.  There were purulent thick secretions throughout the left-sided airways which were suctioned via trap and sent for culture.  The right mainstem was significantly obstructed (approximately 70%) extrinsically with the greatest degree obstruction just proximal to the right upper lobe takeoff.  The bronchus intermedius appeared uninvolved and was widely patent.  The right middle lobe was normal to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  In the proximal aspect of the right lower lobe was some black discoloration of the mucosa but did not appear to be malignant and there is no endobronchial disease or obstruction to at least the first subsegmental bronchi.  
Following inspection the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea and advanced to the distal trachea and connected to the Jet ventilator.  The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and into the airways. Forcep biopsies were taken of the proximal left mainstem mass.  Moderate bleeding was encountered which was treated with topical epinephrine.  After adequate samples were taken APC was used to burn and shave the lesion using the tip of the bronchoscope to remove the devascularized tissue as well as forceps to remove associated debris.  After debulking the left mainstem was approximately 90% patent throughout.  Due to the carinal involvement with fistulization as well as the right mainstem extrinsic obstruction decision was made to place a silicone Y stent into the airway. Measurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 40mm in the tracheal limb, 25mm in the right mainstem limb and 45mm in the left mainstem limb.  The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and we initially attempted to insert the stent using Freitag forceps with indirect laryngoscopy.  This was unsuccessful and at one point the stent was deployed within the proximal esophagus.  The LMA was removed at that point and an endotracheal tube inserted after which we navigated into the proximal esophagus with the flexible bronchoscope, id[REDACTED] the stent and removed with flexible forceps.  After aborting attempts at Freitag placement a 14 mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the airway for dimensional stent deployment.  The Rigid bronchoscope was then advanced to the proximal right mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The Stent was well seated. The trachea and left mainstem were widely patent and the area of disease mucosa within the left mainstem was completely covered.  The right mainstem only improved in diameter to approximately 50% of normal due to continued extrinsic compression on the stent from her esophageal mass. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed.  After removal of the bronchoscope it was noted that the patient had a small laceration on her tongue which developed during the procedure.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
Following administration of intravenous medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, a P190 hybrid video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea appeared normal. The bronchoscope was advanced to the main carina, which was noted to have a sharp angle. The scope was then directed into the left mainstem bronchus, allowing visualization of all segments and subsegments of the left upper lobe, lingula, and lower lobe; no abnormalities were id[REDACTED] on the left side. The bronchoscope was withdrawn to the trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. All segments and subsegments of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes were examined. Purulent material was observed emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The bronchoscope was wedged in this segment, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 60 cc of instilled saline, yielding 20 cc of return fluid. During the lavage, a cavity was visualized in the superior segment of the right lower lobe containing a well-demarcated soft tissue mass with a granular texture, consistent with a mycetoma. The right airway anatomy was notable for fusion of the apical and posterior segments in the right upper lobe; aside from the cavity, no additional masses or lesions were id[REDACTED]. After thorough inspection, multiple forceps samples were obtained from the mass within the cavity. Moderate bleeding ensued and was effectively managed with 4 cc of epinephrine, 30 cc of iced saline, and wedging of the scope in the affected segment, which successfully controlled the hemorrhage.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Indication: Peripheral pulmonary nodule
Target: 8mm nodule in Lingula

PROCEDURE:

After successful induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed. ETT secured in good position.

Initial Airway Inspection:
Trachea normal caliber, carina sharp. Bilateral airways inspected to subsegmental level. No endobronchial lesions. Minimal secretions cleared.

Ventilation Parameters:

PRVC	11	326	12	100	8	17

The single-use disposable Noah Galaxy bronchoscope was introduced into the airway. Navigational registration was performed using the electromagnetic field generator placed beneath the patient.

The scope was navigated to the approximate target location in the Lingula (LB4) based on the pre-operative CT navigational plan. Registration accuracy: 3.9mm.

Once in the target vicinity, a Tool-in-Lesion Tomosynthesis (TiLT+) sweep was performed using the C-arm. The system generated an updated intra-operative 3D volume, revealing a 1.1cm divergence between the pre-op CT target and the actual lesion location due to patient positioning.

The augmented reality target was updated on the navigation screen to match real-time anatomy. Intra-operative tomosynthesis (TiLT) performed to update target location and correct for divergence.

The scope was adjusted to align with the corrected TiLT target. Confirmation of tool position was verified using the augmented fluoroscopy overlay provided by the TiLT system.

Radial EBUS performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric.

Transbronchial needle aspiration performed with 22G needle. 8 passes obtained. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Cytology brushings obtained. Samples sent for Cytology.

ROSE Result: Malignant cells id[REDACTED], consistent with squamous cell carcinoma

Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or complications. The disposable Galaxy scope was removed and discarded at the end of the case.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Ashley Sanders, a 68-year-old male patient, presented to Northwestern Memorial Hospital [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Brian O'Connor, MD, with Kevin Chang assisting.

The clinical indication for this procedure was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 29.4 millimeter part-solid pulmonary nodule located in the LLL lobe, specifically within the lateral basal (B9) segment. The lesion exhibited a negative bronchus sign on computed tomography. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a significant smoking history of 43 pack-years as a current smoker. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 10:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 15.5 millimeters in short axis and 31.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported suspicious for malignancy. At station 10L, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 21.7 millimeters in short axis and 14.6 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 11R, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 20.5 millimeters in short axis and 29.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 22-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - nsclc nos.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 1.8 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 6 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 2 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the LLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 11:36, for a total procedure time of 81 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

"CASE PRESENTATION: Complex Navigation Bronchoscopy

PATIENT [REDACTED]:
A 64-year-old male (Case ID: [REDACTED], Synthetic Name: Martin Lee, MRN: [REDACTED], DOB: [REDACTED]) former smoker with 45 pack-year history presented with an incidentally discovered left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule.

IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS:
Computed tomography demonstrated a 17mm solid nodule in the left lower lobe superior segment without clear bronchus sign. Positron emission tomography revealed moderate FDG uptake with standardized uptake value of 3.9, raising concern for malignancy.

PROCEDURAL APPROACH:
Given the peripheral location and lack of visible bronchus sign, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was selected as the diagnostic modality.

Sedation Protocol:
Deep sedation was induced using propofol continuous infusion (target 50-75 mcg/kg/min) with placement of laryngeal mask airway for airway protection. Maximum Ramsay sedation score achieved was 4. Invasive blood pressure monitoring via radial arterial line provided continuous hemodynamic data.

Technical Details:
The electromagnetic navigation system (SuperDimension™) was employed with pre-procedural CT-to-body registration achieved with registration error <4mm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway planning id[REDACTED] optimal approach via left lower lobe superior segmental bronchus.

The extended working channel was advanced under electromagnetic guidance with periodic fluoroscopic confirmation. Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe deployment initially demonstrated eccentric pattern, prompting repositioning. After adjustment, concentric echogenic pattern was achieved, confirming tool-in-lesion position.

Radiation Exposure:
Total fluoroscopy time: 7.2 minutes
Dose-area product: 268 cGy·cm²
(Elevated exposure due to multiple repositioning attempts)

Sampling Protocol:
Following tool-in-lesion confirmation, systematic sampling was performed:
- Transbronchial needle aspiration: 3 passes (21-gauge needle)
- Transbronchial forceps biopsy: 5 specimens
- Bronchial brush cytology: 2 samples

COMPLICATIONS:
Small apical pneumothorax (approximately 15% by volume) was id[REDACTED] on immediate post-procedural chest radiograph. Patient remained asymptomatic with stable oxygen saturation on room air. Conservative management with observation was elected. Repeat radiography at 4 hours demonstrated stable pneumothorax size. Patient discharged with next-day follow-up radiograph showing partial resolution.

QUALITY METRICS:
- Tool-in-lesion confirmation: Achieved
- Localization success: Yes (after repositioning)
- Sampling protocol adherence: Complete
- Diagnostic yield: Pending final pathology

DISCUSSION:
This case illustrates both the technical challenges and eventual success of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. The need for repositioning to achieve concentric EBUS pattern extended procedure time and radiation exposure but ultimately facilitated diagnostic sampling. The pneumothorax, while requiring observation, represents an accepted risk of transbronchial biopsy techniques.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Indication: Incidental pulmonary nodule requiring tissue diagnosis
Target: 13mm nodule in Lingula

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient id[REDACTED], procedure, and laterality. An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.

Initial Airway Inspection:
The visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions id[REDACTED]. Mild secretions cleared with suction.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
PRVC	12	321	18	80	8	24

The patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.

Electromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 2.0mm.

The device was navigated to the Lingula. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB4) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Superior Lingula.

Radial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Concentric. Lesion confirmed at target location.

Crucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.

Transbronchial needle aspiration performed with 22G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 5 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Protected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.

ROSE Result: Atypical cells present, suspicious for malignancy

The inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.
Follow-up: Results in 5-7 days.

INSTITUTION: [REDACTED]
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Kevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP
FELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)
ANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on [REDACTED] yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative

OPERATION PERFORMED:
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule

CLINICAL SCENARIO:
Patient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. 

General anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. 

Olympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:
- Normal supraglottic structures
- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia
- Carina: sharp, mobile
- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy
- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from [REDACTED] with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment id[REDACTED] at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.

Registration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). 

Steerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.

Radial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.

Fluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).

Cryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:

Cycle 1: 
- Freeze time: 6 minutes
- Temperature at probe tip: -165°C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)
- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20°C)

Cycle 2:
- Freeze time: 6 minutes  
- Temperature: -167°C
- Passive thaw: 4 minutes

Cycle 3:
- Freeze time: 5 minutes
- Temperature: -163°C
- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)

Throughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.

Post-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.

Cryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:
- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)
- No hemorrhage
- No airway perforation
- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)

Complete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. 

Bronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.

FINDINGS:
1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target
2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)
3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS
4. No procedural complications

SPECIMENS: None

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL

INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution

COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively

DRAINS/TUBES: None placed

POST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:
1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring
2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications
4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging
5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain
6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)
7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen
8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake
9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated
10. Diet as tolerated
11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course
- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray
- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)
- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation
- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually

DISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:
Extensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.

Total procedure time: 94 minutes
Fluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes  
Radiation dose: 287 mGy-cm²

ATTESTATION: I was present for and personally performed the key components of this procedure including navigation, targeting, ablation, and post-procedure assessment.

Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]
Institution: [REDACTED]

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 54-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 19.4 mm solid pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RUL anterior (B3), with positive bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 6.7.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 2. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC180F) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 10R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 21.2 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma. Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 8.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed atypical cells. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 13.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.5 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated concentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via augmented fluoroscopy.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed granuloma.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RUL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - adenocarcinoma
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.	Mucous plugging, with diffuse tracheobronchitis. 
2.	Mild Trachobronchiomlalacia 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  flexible bronchoscopy with bronchial washing
CONSCIOUS SEDATION:
1.  Fentanyl 100 mg IV push.
2.  Versed 4 mg IV push.

TOPICAL ANESTHESIA:  29 cc 1% lidocaine 

SPECIMENS SENT:

1.  Bronchial washing sent for cytology and culture
FINDINGS:  
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, all risks and benefits were explained to him.  The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite and administered local anesthesia to the left naris and posterior pharynx.  This was then followed by administration of conscious sedation. The Olympus Q190 bronchoscope was then inserted through the left nare into the posterior oropharynx.   The vocal cords appeared to move normally during pronation. The bronchoscope was then passed into the trachea. Tthere appeared to be mild tracheomalacia as well as diffuse tracheobronchitis with boggy erythematous mucous extending throughout the right and left bronchial trees with thick yellow mucous seen throughout the airways. After suctioning of mucous plugs inspection was performed to at least the first subsegmental bronchi on all left and right sided airways. No endobronchial lesions were id[REDACTED]. The bronchoscope was then advanced to the right lower lobe and the bronchoscope was wedged into the lateral segment.  Bronchoalveolar lavage was then performed at this segment utilizing 90 mL of saline. The wedge was lost due to coughing and suction was reapplied yielding a bronchial wash rather than a true BAL. When this was completed, the airways were again inspected and no evidence of hemorrhage was seen.  The bronchoscope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.

Attending: Dr. Jennifer Liu, MD
Location: [REDACTED]

INDICATION: 53-year-old male with 30 pack-year smoking history presenting with 3-day history of moderate hemoptysis (approximately 100mL/day). CT chest showed bilateral upper lobe bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud opacities. Sputum cultures pending. Bronchoscopy for airway inspection and clearance of blood/secretions.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hemoptysis, likely infectious etiology vs bronchiectasis

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions; no endobronchial lesion or active bleeding source id[REDACTED]

PROCEDURE: Diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic suctioning

SEDATION: Moderate sedation (Midazolam 3mg IV, Fentanyl 50mcg IV)

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient was sedated and the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-P190) was introduced via the oropharynx. The vocal cords appeared normal without lesions or edema. The trachea was patent with normal mucosa. Carina was sharp.

AIRWAY FINDINGS:
- Right mainstem: Patent. Old blood coating the mucosa.
- Right upper lobe: Multiple segments with thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood. Significant bronchiectatic changes. No endobronchial lesions. No active bleeding visualized.
- Bronchus intermedius: Patent with mild inflammation
- Right middle lobe: Mucopurulent secretions, no masses
- Right lower lobe: Bronchiectatic changes, thick secretions
- Left mainstem: Patent, old blood noted
- Left upper lobe: Similar bronchiectatic changes with mucopurulent secretions. No tumor or active bleeding.
- Lingula: Mild secretions
- Left lower lobe: Bronchiectasis, mucopurulent secretions, no source of bleeding id[REDACTED]

THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION:
Extensive suctioning performed throughout all visualized airways. Large quantities of thick mucopurulent secretions and old blood were cleared from bilateral bronchi. No single bleeding source could be id[REDACTED] - the hemoptysis appears to be diffuse from inflamed bronchiectatic airways.

No biopsy was performed as no discrete lesion id[REDACTED]. No BAL performed as secretions already sent from suctioning.

SPECIMENS: 
- Bronchial aspirate/secretions: Bacterial culture, fungal culture, AFB culture, cytology

COMPLICATIONS: None. No active bleeding during or after procedure.

EBL: Trace

POST-PROCEDURE: Patient tolerated well. No respiratory distress. CXR unchanged from pre-procedure.

IMPRESSION & PLAN:
1. Diffuse bilateral bronchiectasis with mucopurulent secretions - no discrete bleeding source id[REDACTED]
2. Hemoptysis likely from diffuse bronchiectatic mucosal inflammation with superimposed infection
3. No endobronchial malignancy id[REDACTED]

Patient: [REDACTED] ""Bill"" Anderson | DOB: [REDACTED] | MRN: [REDACTED]
Institution: [REDACTED]
Physician: Sarah Kim, MD | Fellow: Michael Chang, MD

Patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with end-stage COPD who presented for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. His emphysema is predominantly in the left upper lobe with CT demonstrating 85% destruction and essentially complete fissural integrity at 98%. 

After discussing risks and benefits, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. Monitoring included continuous pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and cardiac telemetry. Moderate sedation was achieved with appropriate medications.

Using a flexible bronchoscope, I entered through the mouth and performed a systematic evaluation of the entire tracheobronchial tree. The vocal cords were normal. The trachea and carina appeared unremarkable. Both mainstem bronchi were patent. Moving to the left upper lobe, I noted the characteristic changes of severe emphysema.

I proceeded with Chartis assessment of the LUL which demonstrated absent collateral ventilation - an ideal finding for valve placement. Subsequently, I placed four Zephyr endobronchial valves: one 5.5mm valve in the lingular segments, and three 4.0mm valves in the upper division bronchi. Each valve was carefully sized and positioned to ensure complete occlusion without migration risk.

The patient tolerated the procedure remarkably well without complications. Post-procedure imaging confirmed appropriate valve positioning and early signs of target lobe volume reduction.

"BRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE NARRATIVE

On [REDACTED], Anthony Price, a 50-year-old female patient, presented to St. Luke's Medical Center [REDACTED] for a combined bronchoscopic procedure consisting of endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy. The procedure was performed by Eric Johnson, MD.

The clinical indication for this procedure was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging had demonstrated a 19.5 millimeter solid pulmonary nodule located in the RLL lobe, specifically within the posterior basal (B10) segment. The lesion exhibited a positive bronchus sign on computed tomography. Positron emission tomography scanning revealed hypermetabolic activity with a maximum standardized uptake value of 5.4. Given the combination of peripheral nodule requiring tissue diagnosis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy necessitating staging, a combined approach was deemed appropriate.

The patient's medical history included a negative smoking history. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification was 3.

Following the administration of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team, the patient was intubated with a 8.0 millimeter endotracheal tube. The procedure commenced at 09:15.

The first component of the procedure involved systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation using linear endobronchial ultrasound. The Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope was advanced through the endotracheal tube, and a thorough airway inspection was performed, revealing no endobronchial abnormalities. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were then surveyed systematically.

At station 10R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 11.4 millimeters in short axis and 28.9 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared round in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - adenocarcinoma. At station 7, a homogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 8.1 millimeters in short axis and 19.7 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared oval in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy. At station 2R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 13.6 millimeters in short axis and 28.0 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 2 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported adequate lymphocytes. At station 4R, a heterogeneous lymph node was id[REDACTED] measuring 22.2 millimeters in short axis and 33.2 millimeters in long axis. The node appeared irregular in shape. Using the 19-gauge needle, 3 aspiration passes were performed. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the specimen and reported malignant - small cell carcinoma.

Following completion of the mediastinal staging component, the procedure transitioned to robotic bronchoscopy for peripheral lesion sampling. The Ion robotic bronchoscopy system, manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, was prepared and registered using CT-to-body methodology. The registration achieved an accuracy of 3.2 millimeters, which was within acceptable parameters for proceeding with navigation.

The robotic catheter was advanced through the bronchial tree toward the target lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10). Navigation was successful, and the catheter reached the planned trajectory endpoint. A twenty-megahertz radial endobronchial ultrasound probe was then deployed through the working channel, revealing a adjacent view of the target lesion. This confirmed appropriate positioning relative to the lesion. Additional confirmation of tool-in-lesion was obtained using fluoroscopy.

Tissue sampling was then performed using multiple modalities to maximize diagnostic yield. Transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained, totaling 7 specimens. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 3 passes through the lesion. Two bronchial brushing specimens were also collected. The on-site cytopathologist evaluated the peripheral specimens and reported malignant - nsclc nos. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the RLL lobe and sent for microbiological analysis including bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli cultures.

The procedure was completed at 10:46, for a total procedure time of 91 minutes. No complications were encountered during the procedure. There was no significant bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved spontaneously. The estimated blood loss was less than ten milliliters. A post-procedure chest radiograph was obtained and demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute abnormality.

The patient was transferred to the recovery area in stable condition. After an uneventful observation period, the patient was discharged home with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions. Follow-up was arranged for review of final pathology results.

In summary, this was a successful combined procedure achieving both mediastinal staging and peripheral lesion tissue diagnosis. The final pathology results will guide subsequent oncologic management and will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 21 mm left lower lobe superior segment nodule in a patient with severe COPD and prior lung volume reduction surgery.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Local ablation of presumed primary lung cancer while preserving remaining lung parenchyma.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT guidance.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: Following induction and intubation, navigation bronchoscopy was used to reach the superior segment bronchus. After CT-to-body divergence correction with tomosynthesis, a transbronchial needle was advanced into the lesion and the extended working channel positioned. A 10-minute microwave ablation was delivered. Cone-beam CT revealed an ablation zone encompassing the lesion but with a narrow posterolateral margin of approximately 3 mm. Given emphysematous parenchyma and prior surgery, a second shorter (5-minute) ablation was delivered with slight catheter repositioning posterolaterally. Final imaging demonstrated a more symmetric ablation zone with a minimal margin of approximately 6 mm. Airways appeared patent on bronchoscopy.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal-esophageal fistula secondary to esophageal CA 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy, Tracheal self-expandable airway stent removal
INDICATIONS: Stent migration and presumed stent infection
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2 cm distal to the vocal cords the patients previous stent could be visualized. Throughout the stent were thick purulent material consistent with infection. The telescoped distal tracheal stent was noted to have migrated into the right mainstem causing complete occlusion of the left mainstem. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid and into the stent. Bronchial lavage was performed with specimen obtained by trap and sent for culture. The proximal edge of the distal telescoped stent was visualized and using flexible forceps we secured the proximal knot and attempted to withdraw the stent. The stent moved only slightly but enough to visualize copious amounts of post-obstructive pus being expressed from the previously obstructed left mainstem. The material was collected in a trap for culture. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and inserted the rigid optic alongside the non-optical rigid forceps. The proximal edge of the distal stent was secured and the stent retracted with the rigid bronchoscope which was removed while grasping tightly to the stent. Both stents were removed with this maneuver and the patient was re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope. The airways which were previously covered by the stent were erythematous and friable, however there was no evidence of airway obstruction from external compression related to esophageal mass. The patient’s esophageal stent could be seen through the posterior trachea covering the TE fistula. The airways were irrigated and cleaned and once we were confident there was no evidence of active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 

Post procedure diagnosis:
-	Stent infection
-	Stent migration resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia.
-	Persistent TE fistula covered by esophageal stent 
-	s/p airway stent removal
Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Await cultures
- consider gastrograffin swallow to ensure esophageal stent is adequately occluding TE fistula

"Indications: Pulmonary Nodule
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The arytenoids were large with a large and floppy epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. On the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just distal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.  We then removed the bronchoscope and inserted the P190 slim bronchoscope into the airway. We attempted to visualize endobronchial disease within the anterior basilar segment of the left lower lobe but could not advance the scope distally enough. We then inserted the radial ultrasound through the working channel of the bronchoscope and an eccentric view of the kno0wn nodule was obtained. We then performed peripheral TBNAs of the point of interest. ROSE did not show obvious malignancy. At this point we removed the slim scope and inserted the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope through the mouth, and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. We attempted to wedge the scope in the lower lobe to potentially visualize the tumor with ultrasound. We saw an unusual area of soft tissue which did not obviously look like would be expected from the nodule. Two biopsies were performed using the 22G EBUS-TBNA needle. ROSE however showed only blood. Finally, fluoroscopy was brought into the room and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left lower lobe and a large sheath catheter with radial ultrasound to the area of known nodule and a concentric view of the lesion was id[REDACTED] with the radial EBUS. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush with fluoroscopic guidance through the sheath. After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE did not id[REDACTED] malignancy on preliminary samples.  After suctioning blood and secretions and once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.
Following completion of the procedure the patient was noted to have audible upper airway sounds and ventilation was difficult.  And decision was made to convert to endotracheal intubation. Initially this was attempted over the bronchoscope however edema within the structures of the middle laryngeal cavity (above the vocal cords this was unsuccessful. Anesthesia was then able to intubate with the glideslope. The bronchoscope was then inserted through the ETT to confirm positioning 2cm above the carina and to suction secretions. The patient was then transferred to the ICU.

"Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy
Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A large, station 4R, lymph node was id[REDACTED] and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 19G Visioshot EBUS-TBNA needles with a total of 7 passes performed. Initial rapid onsite evaluation showed scattered lymphocytes but no evidence of malignancy or granuloma. We then placed the Olympus mini-forceps through the working channel of the EBUS scope and adnaved the forceps through a tract in the airway created by the EBUS needle. We were able to visualize the forceps using the EBUS ultrasound within the lymph node. We then closed and retracted the forceps. This was performed twice and touchpreps were made with the collected specimins which showed abundant non-caseating granulomas on rapid onsite pathological evaluation. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc

"Henry Peterson, MRN [REDACTED], a 78-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Community Hospital on [REDACTED]. The indication was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup with a 23.3mm solid lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 2.8. The patient was ASA class 2 with smoking history of 25 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.

Linear EBUS was performed using the Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope with 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10R (11.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma); station 4R (21.4mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 7 (16.1mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Granuloma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.

The Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system (Noah Medical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 2.4mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RLL posterior basal (B10) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed concentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by cbct. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

The procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.

Date: [REDACTED]
Patient: [REDACTED]
MRN: [REDACTED]
DOB: [REDACTED] (56 years old)

Attending Physician: Dr. Samuel Johnson, MD
Location: [REDACTED]

INDICATION: Diffuse bilateral reticular opacities on CT chest, clinical concern for hypersensitivity pneumonitis vs. id[REDACTED] pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary function shows restrictive pattern with DLCO 52% predicted.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Interstitial lung disease, undefined

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same (pending pathology)

PROCEDURE: 
1. Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage
2. Fluoroscopic-guided transbronchial lung biopsy, right lower lobe
3. Fluoroscopic-guided transbronchial lung biopsy, left lower lobe

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation (Midazolam 4mg, Fentanyl 100mcg)

PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Following IV sedation with continuous monitoring, flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF-1TH190) advanced through the oropharynx. Vocal cords normal, trachea patent. All segmental bronchi visualized and appeared normal with no endobronchial lesions.

AIRWAY INSPECTION: Complete inspection of airways to subsegmental level bilaterally. No mucosal abnormalities, masses, or obstruction.

BAL: Performed in the right middle lobe (RB4) using 3 x 60mL aliquots of sterile saline. Return approximately 90mL of slightly cloudy fluid. Sent for cell count with differential, cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB), and cytology.

TRANSBRONCHIAL BIOPSIES:
Using fluoroscopic guidance (C-arm positioned for AP view), the bronchoscope was advanced into the right lower lobe basal segments. The forceps (2.0mm alligator-type) were advanced under fluoroscopic visualization, positioning the forceps approximately 1-2cm from the pleural surface. 6 transbronchial biopsies were obtained from RB9 and RB10.

The bronchoscope was then repositioned to the left lower lobe. Under fluoroscopy, 5 transbronchial biopsies were obtained from the left lower lobe (LB9-10), again positioning 1-2cm from the pleura.

After biopsies, the biopsy sites were irrigated with cold saline. Bleeding was minimal and self-limited. Final bronchoscopic inspection showed no significant bleeding or airway abnormality.

FLUOROSCOPY TIME: 2.3 minutes
RADIATION DOSE: 38 mGy·cm²

SPECIMENS:
- BAL: Cytology, cell count with diff, bacterial/fungal/AFB culture
- TBLB RLL (6 specimens): Surgical pathology
- TBLB LLL (5 specimens): Surgical pathology

COMPLICATIONS: None. No pneumothorax on post-procedure CXR.

EBL: <10mL

DISPOSITION: Recovery in PACU x 2 hours. Post-procedure CXR negative for pneumothorax. Discharge home with standard bronchoscopy precautions.

FOLLOW-UP: Return to clinic in 1 week for pathology results. If non-diagnostic, will discuss transbronchial cryobiopsy vs. surgical lung biopsy.

Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]
Institution: [REDACTED]

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION

This 77-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 23.2 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the LLL lateral basal (B9), with positive bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 16.0.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.

PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE

COMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION

The convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC180F) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.

Station 11R demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 13.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed suspicious for malignancy. Station 2L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 8.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 4L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 19.6 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma.

COMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION

Following completion of mediastinal staging, the Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy platform (Noah Medical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 2.8 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9).

Radial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated eccentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via radial ebus.

Tissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.

RAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION

On-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed suspicious for malignancy.

PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

The procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.

IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations
2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of LLL pulmonary lesion
3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of suspicious for malignancy
4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed

Procedure: Medical thoracoscopy with talc pleurodesis for recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax.
Patient: [REDACTED], 27-year-old male with recurrent primary left spontaneous pneumothorax.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with left lung isolation using a double-lumen ETT.
Indication: Third episode of left spontaneous pneumothorax with persistent air leak after chest tube drainage.
Procedure details: The patient was positioned in right lateral decubitus. Entry into the left pleural space at the 5th intercostal space yielded a small amount of serosanguinous fluid and air. Thoracoscopic inspection revealed several apical blebs and normal visceral pleura elsewhere. The apical blebs were stapled with an endoscopic stapler by the thoracic surgery team (documented separately). Medical thoracoscopy team performed mechanical pleurodesis along the apical and parietal pleura using gauze pads, followed by insufflation of 4 g sterile talc as dry powder. A 24 Fr chest tube was left at the apex.
Complications: Brief intraoperative desaturation to 88% during lung isolation, resolved with recruitment maneuvers.

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the operating room. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal.  The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was normal appearing with minimal mild thick secretions. The bronchoscope was then advanced to the main carina, which was sharp. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Each segment and subsegment within the right upper, right middle, right lower lobe was well visualized. The right sided airway anatomy was normal and no specific masses or other lesions were id[REDACTED] throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the left main stem. In the distal mainstem there was circumferential erythema of the airway wall without stenosis. There was purulent secretions in the left upper and lower lobe. Bronchial wash was performed in the left upper lobe for culture.  The left upper lobe airways were not stenotic but had chronic erythematous appearance consistent with radiation changes. The left lower lobe take-off was not stenotic but there was moderate stenosis of the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe and severe stenosis (90%) of the anterior medial segment. No specific masses or other lesions were id[REDACTED] throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the left. Following inspection we removed the diagnostic bronchoscope and introduced the T180 therapeutic bronchoscope. Our attention to the stenosis within the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe and gentle dilatation was performed with the 6mm Elation dilating balloon with mild improvement in stenosis. The airway wall was friable however and oozed easily. We then attempted to gently dilate the anterior-medial segment by bypassing the obstruction and gently inflating the balloon to partial expansion (<6mm) and pull back through the stenosis. When this was done relatively brisk bleeding developed. We then wedged the bronchoscope in the left lower lobe for 2 minutes and reassessed. At that point the bleeding had stopped and we felt that given the distal airway disease (likely radiation induced) and only segmental obstruction, the risk/benefit ratio of continued attempts at dilatation favored abstaining from further intervention. At this point, one we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Preoperative Diagnosis:
Lung cancer.
Postoperative Diagnosis:
Lung cancer with malignant airway obstruction.
Procedure Performed:
•	Therapeutic bronchoscopy with tumor cryoextraction, APC, and airway dilation.
•	EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA).
•	Balloon dilation and stent placement in the right lower lobe (RLL).
Indications:
1.	Lung cancer progression requiring repeat tissue sampling for molecular analysis.
2.	Malignant airway obstruction.
Consent:
Obtained from the patient after discussing the procedure, risks, and alternatives.
Sedation:
General anesthesia with an 8.5 mm endotracheal tube (ETT).
Description of Procedure:
The procedure was performed in the main operating room. The patient was positioned supine and underwent general anesthesia with an 8.5 mm ETT. Using the Olympus Q190 standard video-bronchoscope, the trachea was inspected and appeared clear. The left bronchial tree was visualized and found to be normal.
The right mainstem bronchus was clear, while the right upper lobe exhibited submucosal tumor growth with patent airways. The proximal bronchus intermedius (BI) displayed normal luminal structure with approximately 15% obstruction from extraluminal tumor. The distal BI was normal. The right middle lobe (RML) had 80% obstruction due to submucosal infiltration. The right lower lobe (RLL) was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor.
The bronchoscope was exchanged for an EBUS scope. A 2.5 cm lymph node in station 11R1 was id[REDACTED] and biopsied using a 22G ViziShot-2 needle. Five passes were performed, and rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignancy.
The procedure was then switched to a therapeutic bronchoscope (3.2 mm working channel). Forceps biopsies were taken from the proximal RLL, followed by tumor cryoextraction and ablation with argon plasma coagulation (APC). A Fogarty balloon catheter was used to remove distal tumor and debris. Airway dilation of the RLL was performed with an [REDACTED] mm Elation balloon dilator.
The RLL superior segment remained near-completely obstructed, but visualization revealed mostly uninvolved basilar segments with minimal tumor involvement. A 10 x 15 mm Aero stent was placed in the RLL, with the proximal edge positioned just distal to the RML and jailing the superior segment. The basilar segments were patent beyond the stent. The stent was further dilated using a [REDACTED] mm Elation balloon. Post-procedure, the RLL was approximately 85% patent.
The procedure concluded without complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).
Complications:
None.
Estimated Blood Loss:
Minimal.
Recommendations:
1.	Transfer to PACU for post-procedural monitoring.
2.	Return to inpatient service when appropriate.

Indication: Ground glass opacity requiring biopsy
Target: 18mm nodule in Lingula

PROCEDURE:

After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), Carina, LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), Left Mainstem from mucus.

CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
PCV	13	361	15	100	5	16

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 3.1mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Inferior Lingula (LB5). Target lesion is approximately 18mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.6cm away from the planned target.

Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.

The robotic arm was actively locked to maintain rigidity. Vision probe was unlocked and removed from the working channel, leaving the outer catheter locked in position via shape-sensing technology.

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.

Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance.

ROSE Result: Malignant cells id[REDACTED], consistent with adenocarcinoma

Vision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

DISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.
Follow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of left lower paratracheal lymph node (station 4L) using Wang needle (CPT 31629)
INDICATION: Isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy (station 4L, 1.6 cm short axis) in a patient with progressive dyspnea and bilateral hilar fullness; evaluation for sarcoidosis versus lymphoma.

ANESTHESIA/SEDATION: Moderate sedation with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl. Topical 1% lidocaine to nasopharynx, vocal cords, and trachea. The patient breathed spontaneously via native airway with supplemental oxygen.

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
After informed consent and a procedural time-out, a flexible adult bronchoscope was introduced orally. The upper airway, vocal cords, and trachea were normal. The main carina was sharp. The right bronchial tree was normal. On the left, there was mild extrinsic impression on the distal left mainstem corresponding to the paratracheal lymph node but no mucosal lesion.

CONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):
A 21-gauge Wang TBNA needle was advanced through the bronchoscope. Using anatomic landmarks without EBUS guidance, the left lower paratracheal (station 4L) lymph node was targeted via the medial wall of the distal trachea just above the left mainstem origin. Four needle passes were performed with suction. Aspirates contained blood-tinged material with small whitish tissue fragments.

ROSE: Cytotechnologist present for on-site evaluation. ROSE demonstrated abundant benign lymphocytes with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomas. No malignant cells were seen. Adequacy was confirmed after the second pass; two additional passes were obtained for culture and cell block.

SPECIMENS:
Station 4L conventional TBNA x4 passes submitted for cytology, cell block, AFB/fungal cultures, and flow cytometry.

COMPLICATIONS: No significant bleeding, hypoxia, or hemodynamic instability. No linear or radial EBUS, navigation, or fluoroscopy was used; this was a blind conventional Wang needle TBNA.

DISPOSITION/PLAN:

Patient ID: [REDACTED]
Date of procedure: [REDACTED]
Attending physician: Dr. L. Chen
Assistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; anesthesia team; radiology technologist.

Pre-procedure diagnosis: 12 mm part-solid right upper lobe apical segment ground-glass nodule in a patient with prior left upper lobectomy for adenocarcinoma.
Post-procedure diagnosis: Same.
Indication: Parenchyma-sparing local therapy for presumed metachronous stage IA adenocarcinoma in a patient with reduced pulmonary reserve.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.

Procedures performed:
1. Robotic-assisted navigation bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with integrated Cios Spin mobile 3D C-arm guidance.
2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right upper lobe apical nodule using Emprint catheter.

Procedure description: Following induction of general anesthesia, the Ion robotic bronchoscope was docked and advanced toward the planned pathway to the apical segment nodule. Shape-sensing navigation allowed precise catheter steering to the ninth-generation airway. A Cios Spin 3D rotational scan was obtained and registered, confirming the nodule position and updating the navigation plan. A flexible transbronchial needle was advanced into the lesion under fluoroscopic and 3D overlay guidance, followed by placement of the extended working channel 1 cm beyond the lesion center. The Emprint catheter was introduced and two overlapping ablations (8 minutes and 6 minutes) were delivered to cover the lesion and ensure at least a 5 mm margin. Post-ablation Cios Spin images demonstrated a confluent ablation zone with a minimal margin of approximately 7 mm circumferentially. Repeat bronchoscopic inspection showed no significant bleeding or mucus plugging.

Estimated blood loss: <5 mL.
Complications: None immediate. No pneumothorax on fluoroscopy.
Disposition: Extubated in the operating room and admitted overnight for observation given prior contralateral lobectomy; planned follow-up CT in 3 months.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
