No address on file
 
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  Andres Flores Luna is a 63 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
PROCEDURE:  
31600 Incision of windpipe (perc trach)
76536 Ultrasound of Neck
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a procedure when anatomy was challenging due to limited neck mobility. This made for a narrow window to perform the procedure and required four additional attending physicians to assist with the case. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, Severity of patient's condition, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31600 Incision of windpipe (perc trach). 
 
ATTENDING:  
Jacob Perry MD
 
ASSISTANT:   Christina Johnson MD and Emily Muller MD
 
Support Staff: 
RN: Lyndsey Lohan and Victor Vicente
RT: Mandy Malone
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Neck Ultrasound was performed to evaluate for any abnormal vessel, mass, structures at the site of percutaneous tracheostomy.  There were no significant vessels/mass were noted overlying the tracheostomy site on examination from the laryngeal prominence to the sternal notch.  
 
The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization.  The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized.  Next, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  
 
There were issues with the ventilator, so manual bagging of the patient was performed. 
 
Lidocaine 1% 3ml ml was injected into the anterior neck.  A 1 cm incision was made horizontally with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.  A syringe with 1% Lidocaine was then attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization.  This needle was removed and the 18 gauge introducer catheter over needle was then advanced into this position under direct visualization.   The inner needle was removed and the introducer catheter left in place.  Next, a J-wire was passed through the catheter, also visualized with the bronchoscope.  The site was then dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.  
 
The 14 Fr dilator was then removed from the guide wire and an 8 Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level.  The White Rhino dilator was placed over the guiding catheter until the positioning mark was visualized via the bronchoscope.  The White Rhino dilator was then removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
 
Finally a Portex 7.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization.  The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were then removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place.  This was confirmed to be in good position bronchoscopically.  The Endotracheal tube was then removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube.   A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications. The staff physician was present throughout the entire procedure. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Andres Flores Luna is a 63 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure.
 
-Suture removal in ~7 days
-First tracheostomy change in ~10 days
