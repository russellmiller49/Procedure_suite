NOTE_ID:  note_129 SOURCE_FILE: note_129.txt Procedure Performed:
Right-sided medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and chest tube insertion

Indication:
Exudative pleural effusion

Medications:
Moderate sedation per anesthesia record

Topical Anesthesia:
Lidocaine 1%, 20 mL

The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Pertinent laboratory studies and imaging were reviewed. A procedural time-out was performed.

The patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position on the procedural bed, with pressure points appropriately padded. The right-sided pleural entry site was identified using ultrasound guidance. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (ChloraPrep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry site was infiltrated with 20 mL of 1% lidocaine. A 1-cm skin incision was made, and blunt dissection was carried down to the pleural space. Finger sweep revealed pleural adhesions, which were lysed bluntly.

An 8-mm disposable primary port was placed in the right fourth intercostal space at the mid-axillary line. After air entrainment and lung deflation, an Olympus semi-rigid pleuroscope was introduced through the trocar into the pleural cavity. Suction was applied, and approximately 1,600 mL of serosanguinous pleural fluid was removed.

The pleura appeared abnormal, with areas of isolated nodularity and plaques most consistent with pachypleuritis. No significant adhesions were present. Multiple biopsies of abnormal posterior parietal pleura were obtained using forceps. Additionally, a large pleural specimen was obtained using an electrocautery knife. Approximately nine total biopsies were obtained and sent for histopathological examination. Minimal bleeding was observed.

Following biopsies, talc pleurodesis was performed using a combination of talc poudrage and talc slurry, with a total of 5 grams of talc instilled. The primary port was then removed, and a 24-French chest tube was placed through the existing stoma, sutured in place, and connected to a pleuro-vac. The chest tube was dressed and covered with a transparent dressing.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.

A post-procedure chest radiograph demonstrated the chest tube in appropriate position, with the proximal side hole just at the pleural wall and a trace apical pneumothorax.

Complications:
None immediate

Estimated Blood Loss:
10 mL

Post-Procedure Diagnosis:
Pleural effusion

Recommendations:

Admit to inpatient service (planned)

Chest tube to suction; plan for removal once output is <150 mL/day

Pain management following talc pleurodesis, including narcotics as needed

Await pathology results

Inpatient Interventional Pulmonology consult team to follow

NOTE TEXT:

NOTE_ID:  note_264 SOURCE_FILE: note_264.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Endotracheal tumor 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.         Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation(CPT 31641)
INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords There were 3 polypoid lesions at the same level blocking about 90% of the airway during exhalation which moved in a ball valve fashion with inhalation resulting in about 50% obstruction of the airway.  Additionally there were multiple small polypoid (> 50) lesions surrounding distal to the lesion originating from all parts of the airway (Anterior trachea, posterior trachea, lateral trachea) which terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina. The right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the proximal trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the large polypoid lesions beginning with the 3 proximal obstructive lesions and the lesions once free from the wall were easily removed from the airway with suction and collected for pathological assessment. After these lesions were removed about 10 other lesions in the airway which were anatomically amenable to snare were removed in the same fashion. We then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 90% open in comparison to unaffected areas. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications. Of note we considered airway stent placement as a barrier effect  as the lesions regrew very quickly (< 3 months) after the previous bronchoscopic debulking procedure however in our discussions with the patient prior to the procedure he expressed reluctance to have stent placed due to possible cough associated with the stent and the fact that he only restarted chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. I suspect that these lesions will recur unless he has a profound response to systemic treatment and possible radiation and if I need to debulk again I will strongly advocate for placement of a covered tracheal stent.
Recommendations: 
•	Transfer patient back to ward room 
•	Await final pathology results  
•	Will need to speak with oncology regarding other treatment options which might include PDT or brachytherapy.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation under flouroscopic and EBUS guidance with transbronchial needle aspiration, Transbronchial biopsy and bronchioalveolar brush.  

CPT 31654 Bronchoscope with Endobronchial Ultrasound guidance for peripheral lesion
CPT 31629 Flexible bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic trans-bronchial needle aspiration
CPT 31628 Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with transbronchial lung biopsy(s), single lobe
CPT 31623 Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with brushing or protected brushings
CPT +31624 Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with bronchial alveolar lavage
CPT +31627 Bronchoscopy with computer assisted image guided navigation

INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   Left upper lobe lung nodule            
MEDICATIONS:    GA
Pre-operative diagnosis: Right upper lobe nodule
Post-operative diagnosis: SAA
Anesthesia: General per Anesthesia

PROCEDURE: History and physical has been performed. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained. Patient identification and proposed procedure were verified by the physician, anesthesia team, nurse, and pulmonary team. Time out was performed at 0819. The bronchoscope was introduced through the laryngeal mask airway and into the trachea.  The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree of bilateral lungs was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. The right upper lobe was noted to have an anomalous inferior takeoff in addition to the anterior, apical, and posterior segments. There were no endobronchial lesions and no excessive secretions.
 The Covidien superDimension probe was then advanced and registration was performed. The right upper lobe nodule was accessed by the anomalous segment (see below), located using electromagnetic navigation and the site confirmed with radial ultrasound. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed under flouroscopic guidance and adequate tissue confirmed by ROSE. Multiple insturments to include transbronchoscopic needles, forceps (tranbronchial lung biopsy) and brushes were utilized. Five needle biopsies three forceps biopsies, and one needle brush biopsy were obtained in total. Finally, inspection bronchoscopy was performed and hemostasis was confirmed. The procedure was accomplished without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications. EBL 5cc.

SPECIMEN SENT TO THE LABORATORY:
--5 needle biopsies of the right middle lobe
--1 brush biopsies of the  right middle lobe
--3 forceps biopsies

The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-D/C From CEC when discharge criteria are met
-Patient will be notified when biopsy results return

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_191 SOURCE_FILE: note_191.txt Procedure Name: EBUS bronchoscopy
Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically enlarged station 7, 4R and 4L lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration using Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge and 19G needles. At least 5 needle passes were performed at each lymph node station. All samples were sent for routine cytology. ROSE identified granulomas within the 4R lymph node. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. There was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful EBUS bronchoscopy
- Will await final pathology results

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 129 (Thoracoscopy)
Score: 75 / 100 Status: ⚠️ WARNING

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucination (Critical): The system derived CPT 31641 (Bronchoscopy with destruction of tumor) based on the text "electrocautery".

Reality: The procedure was a Medical Thoracoscopy (Pleuroscopy), not a Bronchoscopy. The electrocautery was used on the pleura (likely 32654 or included in biopsy), not the bronchus. Coding 316xx for a 326xx procedure is a major anatomical error.

Correction: Remove 31641. Ensure thermal_ablation logic distinguishes between airway and pleural applications.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Detail: 32609 (Thoracoscopy with biopsy) was performed. While 32650 (Pleurodesis) often bundles/supersedes it, 32609 should be detected as "performed" in the registry even if dropped for billing. The registry shows medical_thoracoscopy.biopsies_taken: true, which is correct, but the billing engine focused on the wrong code (31641).

3. Logic & Coding
Schema: Valid.

Logic: The "thermal_ablation" boolean was triggered by "electrocautery", which then deterministically mapped to 31641. The system failed to scope the electrocautery to the pleural procedure context.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 264 (Therapeutic Bronch)
Score: 85 / 100 Status: ⚠️ WARNING

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucination (Outcome): outcomes.procedure_success_status set to "Aborted".

Text Evidence: "terminated about 1cm proximal to the main carina".

Reality: This text described the lesion's extent ("lesions... which terminated about 1cm proximal..."), NOT the procedure. The note actually says "procedure was completed" and "90% open".

Impact: False negative on procedure completion success.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Captured: Rigid bronchoscopy, mechanical debulking, APC, and aspiration were all correctly captured.

Captured: Stent consideration (but not placement) was correctly excluded.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency: 31640 (Excision) and 31645 (Aspiration) correctly selected. 31641 correctly dropped as bundled.

Granularity: Captured rigid barrel size (10mm) and lesion details well.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 027 (Pleural Fibrinolytics)
Score: 100 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Matched: Correctly identified 32562 (Subsequent fibrinolysis) based on "dose #4".

Matched: Correctly identified Ultrasound 76604.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Details: Captured specific agents (tPA, DNase) and doses (10mg, 5mg).

Logic: Correctly set chest_tube.performed = False (as it was existing), preventing a false 32551.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency: Perfect.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 182 (Navigational Bronch)
Score: 70 / 100 Status: ❌ FAIL

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Classification Error: Registry marked linear_ebus.performed = True.

Reality: The note describes Radial EBUS ("site confirmed with radial ultrasound"). There is no mention of mediastinal staging or linear probe usage.

Impact: Confuses staging procedures with diagnostic peripheral procedures.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed CPT: 31654 (Radial EBUS) was listed in the note header and described in text ("confirmed with radial ultrasound"), but missing from the final billing.cpt_codes list.

Note: The audit_warnings show "31654: ML detected... but deterministic derivation missed it." This confirms a pipeline gap.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency: The system correctly bundled 31622 but failed to uplift the Radial EBUS evidence to the final code set despite high ML confidence.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 191 (EBUS Staging)
Score: 95 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Matched: Correctly extracted stations 4R, 4L, 7.

Matched: Correctly parsed needle gauges (22G, 19G).

2. Completeness (Recall)
Granularity: Node-level events ("4R -> granulomas") were captured in node_events.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency: Correctly derived 31653 (EBUS 3+ stations).

Logic: complications.bleeding (Grade 1) was derived from "blood was suctioned". This is technically accurate ("Mild bleeding" managed endoscopically), though clinically minor.

🏆 Summary
Success Rate: 2/5 PASS, 2/5 WARNING, 1/5 FAIL.

Critical Issue 1 (Anatomy): Confusion between Bronchoscopy (316xx) and Thoracoscopy (326xx) when tools like "electrocautery" overlap.

Critical Issue 2 (Context): Misinterpreting "lesion terminated" as "procedure terminated" (Aborted status).

Critical Issue 3 (Differentiation): Confusing Linear vs. Radial EBUS contexts.

Recommendation:

Refine Scope Filters: Ensure thermal_ablation rules check procedure_type (Bronch vs. Thoracoscopy) before assigning CPTs.

Improve Aborted Logic: Restrict "aborted" keywords to the Procedure Outcomes section or proximity to "procedure stopped".

Fix Radial EBUS: Ensure explicit mentions of "Radial EBUS" force radial_ebus=True and linear_ebus=False if no stations are listed.
