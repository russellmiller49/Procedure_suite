The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_153 SOURCE_FILE: note_153.txt Indications: Hilar adenopathy, presumed metastatic breast CA
Procedure Performed: EBUS bronchoscopy single station.
Pre-operative diagnosis: hilar adenopathy 
Post-operative diagnosis: malignant hilar adenopathy 
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically suspicious station 11Ri lymph node. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically suspicious station 11Ri lymph node. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed.",

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_140 SOURCE_FILE: note_140.txt Procedure: Bronchoscopy with radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS)
Indication: Esophageal cancer with suspected malignant airway involvement
Anesthesia/Ventilation: General anesthesia with controlled mechanical ventilation. Topical 2% lidocaine to tracheobronchial tree (6 mL).
Pre-procedure status: ASA III. Standard consent and time-out performed. Labs and imaging reviewed.

Technique

Q180 slim video bronchoscope introduced via tracheostomy to the tracheobronchial tree.

T180 therapeutic bronchoscope also introduced via tracheostomy.

UM-BS20-26R 20 MHz radial probe ultrasound advanced through the working channel to assess airway wall and adjacent structures.

Airway Examination

Tracheostomy stoma: Normal.

Trachea: Normal caliber.

Carina: Sharp.

Bronchial tree: Examined to at least the first subsegmental level.

Mucosa/anatomy: Normal throughout; no endobronchial lesions and no secretions.

Radial Probe Ultrasound Findings

Radial EBUS performed at:

Proximal left mainstem bronchus takeoff

Mid and distal trachea

Esophageal tumor visualized infiltrating the adventitia of the posterior wall of the left mainstem bronchus.

Minimum distance from esophageal mass to left mainstem bronchial lumen: 3.2 mm.

No intraluminal airway invasion identified on bronchoscopic inspection.

Impression

Malignant extrinsic airway involvement from esophageal cancer, affecting the adventitia of the posterior wall of the left mainstem bronchus.

No endobronchial disease and no intrinsic airway obstruction at time of examination.

Findings suggest high-risk proximity of tumor to airway, relevant for oncologic planning and future airway risk assessment.

Complications / Blood Loss

No immediate complications.

Estimated blood loss: None.

Specimens: None collected.

Post-Procedure Plan

Routine post-procedure observation until discharge criteria met.

Follow-up with primary/oncology team as previously scheduled.

Success rate: 100.0%
================================================================================
🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 051
Score: 100 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None.

Data Verification:

BAL: 60cc instilled / 20cc returned matches text exactly. Locations (RB4, RB5) match verbatim.

Therapeutic Aspiration: Locations (RMS, Bronchus Intermedius, LMS) match text. Material (Mucus plug) matches.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: None.

Missed Details: None.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

31624 (BAL): Supported by bal.performed=true.

31645 (Therapeutic Aspiration): Supported by therapeutic_aspiration.performed=true (Initial).

31622 (Diagnostic): Correctly identified as bundled/dropped in favor of surgical codes.

Schema Compliance: Valid.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 045
Score: 95 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS (With minor coding nuance)

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None.

Data Verification:

Ultrasound: "Large", "Anechoic", "Thin loculations", "Diminished" motion — all attributes extracted perfectly.

Thoracentesis: Extracted as performed.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: None.

Missed Details: None.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

76604 (US Chest): Correctly coded.

32554 (Thoracentesis w/o imaging): The header lists 32555 (w/ imaging), but the JSON output 32554.

Analysis: The note describes a full ultrasound exam (findings block) followed by the procedure ("Based on Ultrasound Evaluation... Thoracentesis... will proceed"). It does not explicitly state "real-time guidance" during the needle insertion. The pipeline conservatively (and likely correctly per strict coding rules) separated the diagnostic US (76604) from the non-guided or statically-guided procedure (32554).

Schema Compliance: Valid.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 153
Score: 100 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None.

Data Verification:

Station 11Ri: Extracted correctly from text "station 11Ri lymph node".

Needle: "22 gauge" extracted correctly.

Outcome: "Suspicious" / "Malignancy" captured in node events.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: None.

Missed Details: None.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

31652 (EBUS 1-2 stations): Correctly derived from 1 sampled station (11R).

Schema Compliance: Valid.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 035
Score: 100 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None.

Data Verification:

Fibrinolysis: Agents (tPA, DNase) and Doses (10mg, 5mg) match text.

Chest Tube: Correctly identified as History/Pre-existing ("Date of chest tube insertion: 12/15/25" vs current date). pleural_procedures.chest_tube.performed is correctly False (inferred from absence in "performed" list, though audit log shows it was handled).

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: None.

Missed Details: None.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

32562 (Fibrinolysis, subsequent): Correctly selected based on "dose #: 3" and "subsequent day" in text.

Schema Compliance: Valid.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report: Note 140
Score: 90 / 100 Status: ⚠️ WARNING

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations:

procedures_performed.linear_ebus.performed: True.

Correction: The note describes Radial EBUS ("Bronchoscopy with radial probe", "Radial Probe Ultrasound Findings"). There is no mention of Linear (Convex) EBUS or nodal staging. The system likely flagged "EBUS" keyword without distinguishing type context in the boolean classifier.

Data Verification:

Tracheostomy Route: Correctly extracted (established_tracheostomy_route: true).

Radial EBUS: Correctly extracted (radial_ebus.performed: true).

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: None (Diagnostic work captured).

Missed Details: The system correctly identified "Specimens: None collected", so no biopsy events were created.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

31615 (Bronch via Trach): Correctly coded.

No 31652 (Linear EBUS): Correct. Even though linear_ebus.performed was hallucinated as True, the logic saved the billing because stations_sampled was empty.

No 31654 (Radial EBUS): Correct. Radial EBUS requires intervention/biopsy to be billable. Since no specimens were collected, the add-on code was correctly dropped.

Schema Compliance: Valid.

4. Corrected JSON Snippet
For Note 140:

JSON
"procedures_performed": {
  "linear_ebus": {
    "performed": false,  // Was true
    "node_events": []
  },
  "radial_ebus": {
    "performed": true
  }
}
📊 Summary
Total Notes: 5

Perfect Extractions: 3 (051, 153, 035)

Valid but Nuanced: 1 (045 - Coding judgment on "Guidance")

Extraction Error: 1 (140 - linear_ebus flag hallucination, though billing remained correct)

Overall Pipeline Status: Strong. The evidence-based verification is working well for billing derivation (preventing the Linear EBUS hallucination in Note 140 from becoming a billing error). The granular data extraction for needles, stations, and medication dosages is highly accurate.
