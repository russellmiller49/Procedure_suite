NOTE_ID:  note_092 SOURCE_FILE: note_092.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents with airway stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)

31635 Foreign body removal
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required multiple (5) separate applications of spray cryotherapy and required multiple forms of bronchoscopy (flexible and rigid) in order to adequately treat the patient. This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing     
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Bronchoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
The flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced.
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Not fully assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Anterior trachea with well-healed tracheostomy site, otherwise normal
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Anastamosis sutures intact, somewhat tortuous bronchus intermedius. RML with stent in place. Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Anastamosis sutures intact. Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
During initial gentle suctioning/therapeutic aspiration at the RML the iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent became dislodged and completely extruded from the RML into the distal bronchus intermedius. 
Foreign body removal was performed:  the stent was grasped with pulmonary forceps and removed en bloc with the therapeutic bronchoscope.
There was some oozing blood from the distal RML bronchus after the stent was dislodged.  This bleeding was easily controlled with endobronchial cold saline, epinephrine 0.2mg, and tranexamic acid 200mg.
RML AFTER STENT DISLODGEMENT
 
After induction of muscle relaxants, LMA was removed and tooth or gum protector was placed. The black bronchoscope ventilating rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed.  The bronchoscope barrel was then positioned into the proximal right mainstem bronchus.
Area of stenosis at the right middle lobe was treated with the following modalities:

Mechanical	Pulmonary alligator forceps	N/A	N/A	Good granulation tissue removal from distal RML bronchus
Cryospray	Cryospray cryotherapy catheter	Low-flow	10-second application x 5 total applications	Excellent application of spray cryotherapy to proximal RML bronchus and around the RML take-off
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2).  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 70% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. 
After the stent extraction, light mechanical excision, and balloon dilation, the RML was widely patent with patent segmental airways.  Decision was made to not place another stent at this time, as concern that it could easily dislodge.  Will also allow for stent vacation to help break chain of stent bacterial colonization and to see how the RML tissue responds to the cryospray treatment.  Will monitor this airway closely and plan for close bronchoscopy airway evaluation in 2-3 weeks.
The rigid bronchoscope was extubated.  LMA was replaced by anesthesia team.
Flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
RML AFTER STENT SPRAY CRYOTHERAPY AND BALLOON DILATION
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--RML stent (path)

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_230 SOURCE_FILE: note_230.txt Procedure Name: EBUS Staging Bronchoscopy. (CPT 31652 convex probe endobronchial ultrasound sampling 2 or fewer hilar or mediastinal stations or structures).
Indications: diagnosis and staging of suspected lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.  The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4R and 10R lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4R Lymph node, using an Olympus Visioshot2 EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE was consistent with malignancy. After obtaining adequate tissue for diagnosis and molecular markers the EBUS bronchoscope was removed and the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

NOTE_ID:  note_151 SOURCE_FILE: note_151.txt Tube Thoracostomy Procedure Note

Indication: Hemothorax

The patient was positioned in the usual fashion and the left chest was prepped and draped in a sterile manner using chlorhexidine. Local anesthesia was achieved with a total of 10 mL of 1% lidocaine infiltrated into the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superior aspect of the rib periosteum, and parietal pleura.

A 2-cm incision was made parallel to the rib in the left midaxillary line at the level of the fourth rib. Blunt dissection was carried out through the subcutaneous tissue superficial and superior to the rib down to the level of the pleura. The pleural space was entered bluntly, with immediate expression of a large volume of blood. The parietal pleural opening was then expanded bluntly, and a finger was inserted and carefully swept in all directions to confirm intrapleural placement and to assess for adhesions.

A 34 French chest tube was then inserted using the operator’s finger as a guide. The tube was directed inferiorly and advanced without difficulty. Blood continued to pour from the insertion site during suturing of the tube to the skin, with approximately 1 liter of dark blood lost externally, outside of the pleurovac. The chest tube was then securely connected to a pleurovac with tape, at which time an additional approximately 1 liter of blood drained rapidly before output slowed.

A sterile occlusive dressing was applied over the insertion site. A second, nonfunctional chest tube was removed, revealing a large fibrin clot completely occluding the lumen. The removal site bled briskly, and three interrupted sutures were placed, after which hemostasis was achieved.

No immediate complications were noted. A post-procedure chest x-ray is pending at the time of this note.

Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: Approximately 2 liters

NOTE_ID:  note_186 SOURCE_FILE: note_186.txt Indications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis/staging. 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. Anatomy was normal with exception of fish mouth dynamic obstruction of the right middle lobe. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and advanced into the apical segment of the right upper lobe were endobronchial tumor was visualized.  The radial EBUS probe was inserted through the bronchoscope and advanced into the airway and an eccentric view of the lesion was identified. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle forceps and brush. ROSE identified malignancy. After adequate samples were obtained, the video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was only met in station station 4R and 11Rs. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation showed adequate lymphocytes in the 4R lymph node and were non-diagnostic in the 11Rs. The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted again into the airway and 5 more forceps biopsies were obtained in the apical segment of the right upper lobe for cell block and molecular analysis. The bronchoscope was then removed and the Q190 re-inserted into the airways. DECAMP research samples were then performed with brushing within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and transbronchial biopsies in the RUL, RML and LUL. We then observed for evidence of active bleeding and none was identified. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 

Complications: 	
-None 
Estimated Blood Loss:  5 cc.
Recommendations:
- Transfer to post-procedure unit
- Await biopsy results 
- Discharge home once criteria met.
Dr. Miller (Attending) was personally present and involved in all key phases of the procedure.
