NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_100 SOURCE_FILE: note_100.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure. 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
ANESTHESIA: 
Local ONLY
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Lidocaine applied to trachea, main carina, RMS, & LMS.
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for persistent pale plaque of tissue along the anterior wall of the RMSB/BI and RML orifice.   The previously seen metallic hemoclip near the RMS anastomosis posterior membrane is no longer present.  The RML orifice is now completely stenosed by overlying necrotic debris.  Unable to probe into the airway to achieve patency. The LMSB anastomosis shows mild granulation tissue and similar pale soft tissue plaque along the anterior aspect of the distal LMSB. Segmental airways on the left are widely patent. Clear secretions bilaterally. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, and RLL and LLL from mucus. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure and bronchial anastomotic dehiscence and stenosis. 
-Plan for bronchoscopy under GA for mngmnt of RML stenosis - likely excision of overlying debris, balloon dilation, and stent placement.  Likely on [REDACTED].

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_101 SOURCE_FILE: note_101.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
ANESTHESIA: 
Local ONLY
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for persistent pale plaque of tissue along the anterior wall of the RMSB/BI and RML orifice. The RMSB anastomosis continues to show a partially exposed hemoclip along the posterior membrane. The RML orifice is stenosed to ~75% of its normal patency. The LMSB anastomosis shows mild granulation tissue and similar pale soft tissue plaque along the anterior aspect of the distal LMSB. Segmental airways on the left are widely patent. Clear secretions bilaterally. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior-basal Segment of RLL (RB8).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S):

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required multiple modalities and increased effort to access and open the RML. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31629 TBNA single lobe   
31652 EBUS sampling 1 or 2 nodes
31630 Balloon dilation
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision . 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Flexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
  
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Not fully assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: RML orifice unable to be identified on initial inspection since the airway had swallowed up the prior RML stent and this was now fused shut. No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
VIEW OF OBLITERATED RML AND PATENT RLL FROM BRONCHUS INTERMEDIUS
 
PRIOR VIEW OF RML AND RLL FROM PRIOR BRONCHOSCOPY [REDACTED]
 
PRIOR VIEW OF RML AND RLL FROM PRIOR BRONCHOSCOPY [REDACTED] 
The RML was unable to be identified and there was suspicion that the RML stent migrated distally with overgrowth of tissue, effectively closing off the RML. The EBUS scope was utilized to identify the RML orifice and distal stent. Transbronchial needle aspiration was utilized to re-create/re-open the RML orifice. During this maneuver, frank pus was aspirated from the RML.
RML stent with needle within the airway:
 
Once an pinhole opening was made with above TBNA, pulmonary forceps were used to probe the RML and blunt dissect to widen the opening.
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RML.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology.
A 4Fr Fogarty balloon was inserted to further open the RML.  
Purulent secretions distal to the obstruction were aspirated. 
The hybrid scope was used to explore the distal RML and the medial and lateral subsegments were successfully identified.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2).  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
After above excision and dilation, the RML was finally patent and the stent could be visualized. 
VIEW OF RML AFTER RECANNALIZATION
 
VIEW OF DISTAL RML AFTER RECANNALIZATION
 
The foreign body/old stent (iCAST 7mm x 16mm) was identified and grasped with the pulmonary rat tooth forceps. This was removed en bloc with the bronchoscope.
Bleeding/oozing was noted from the RML and this was treated with multiple modalities including cold saline, TXA, epinephrine, and electrocautery/coagulation.
Endobronchial debris and hemorrhage at RML was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	Probe 	Forced coag	2-5sec	Ablation/Coagulation
 
In effort to prevent stent from getting swallowed up again, a longer stent was selected. Next, an iCAST 7mm x 22mm stent was deployed into the RML however this blocked off the RLL and was subsequently removed en bloc with the bronchoscope using the rat tooth forceps.
An iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent was placed in the RML but was noted to be too proximal and was subsequently removed en bloc with the bronchoscope using the rat tooth forceps.
Another iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent was placed in the RML and seated appropriately. 
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2) through the stent to seat the stent.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds.
RML stent at end of case:
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent (path)
--RML BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway stenosis. The patient's RML was closed off around his iCAST stent. The RML was reopened and the stent was removed. A new iCAST stent (7mm x 16mm) was placed. Patient tolerated the procedure and there were no immediate complications.
--Follow-up path and BAL results
--Repeat bronchoscopy in 2 weeks for re-evaluation
--Augmentin (875mg-125mg) 1 tab by mouth twice daily for 7 days

NOTE_ID:  note_194 SOURCE_FILE: note_194.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant Central Airway Obstruction 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant Central Airway Obstruction

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
CPT 31641 Bronchoscopy destruction of tumor or relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
CPT 31624 Bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage
INDICATIONS: Airway stent occlusion 

Sedation: General Anesthesia

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The patients known Silicone Y-stent was well positioned. There was signifigant thich dry mucous with mild obstruction of the tracheal limb, moderate obstruction of the left bronchial limb and significant obstruction of the right bronchial limb and the telescoping right mainstem covered metallic stent. The right upper lobe was partially obstructed by the distal tip of the SEM but there was no evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia and all right sided segmental airways were patent without endobronchial disease. On the left the distal mainstem, lower lobe bronchi were patient without evidence of endobronchial disease. At the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe takeoff there was partially obstructive endobronchial tumor causing approximately 40% reduction in caliber which did not warrant treatment at this time. Through a combination of mechanical debulking with the bronchoscope tip, forceps debulking and use of sodium bicarbonate instillation the adhesive mucous was slowly removed, with near complete recanalization of the stents. Subsequently a mini BAL was performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe with 40cc instillation and 30cc return. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 

Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Discharge once criteria met.

NOTE_ID:  note_241 SOURCE_FILE: note_241.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal stenosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Complex Tracheal stenosis s/p stent placement 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Tracheal self-expandable airway stent placement
INDICATIONS: Symptomatic tracheal stenosis
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords was a long segment of A-shaped stenosis measuring 3.5 cm with maximal airway obstruction of 90%.  Distal to the stenosis the mid and distal trachea appeared normal. All right and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were examined and normal without endobronchial disease or airway distortion. External markers were placed on the patient’s chest with fluoroscopic observation at the proximal and distal edges of the stenosis. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea through the flexible bronchoscope. The bronchoscope was then removed with the jagwire left in place. A 16x40 mm Ultraflex uncovered self-expandable metallic stent was then inserted over the guidewire and using the external markers positioned in proper place and then deployed. The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted. The stent was well positioned and partially compressed externally. A 14/16.5/18 mm Elation dilatational balloon was used to dilate the stent after which the airway was approximately 90% of normal caliber.  At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 

Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Discharge once criteria met.
- Plan for repeat evaluation and possible stent replacement in approximately 2 weeks.
