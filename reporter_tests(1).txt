Prepare an operative report for a 96 year old female undergoing bronchoscopy for airway obstruction. Note a complication: EBUS caused a tear in the distal tracheal posterior membrane. GI consult ruled out esophageal injury. Initial studded silicone stent failed because migration occurred immediately upon deployment requiring removal. Successful placement of straight silicone stent measuring 18mm x 50mm and dilation to 18 mm.
