Medications: General Anesthesia, 

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 

 

Following intravenous medications and intubation by anesthesia, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. At the carina for the superior segment of the left lower lobe was a mucosal irregularity concerning for endobronchial tumor. Otherwise bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal without other endobronchial lesions. Enbobronchial forcep biopsies were performed of the superior segment lesion with minimal bleeding. The Covidien superDimension locatable guide was then inserted through the working channel and registration was performed. The Edge 180 degree extended working channel was then attached to the bronchoscope.  Using navigational map we attempted to advance into the proximity of the lesion within the left lower lobe lesion. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with peripheral needle with on ROSE were non-diagnostic. Due to intermittent hypoxia and rising peak pressures decision was made to abort peripheral biopsies and BAL of the anterior segment of the left lower lobe was performed with 90cc instillation and 25cc return.  Repeat fluoroscopic imaging showed large left sided pneumothorax.  

The left axillary area was the prepped in a sterile fashion. A Yueh centesis needle was advanced into the pleural space. Air was easily aspirated and the catheter was advanced into the space and needle withdrawn. A guidewire was inserted through the catheter. A small skin incision was made at the wire site and a two-step dilatation of pleural tract was then performed via Seldinger technique. The Cooke 12F pigtail catheter was then inserted with its trocar in place over the wire. The trocar was subsequently removed with the wire. The catheter was subsequently connected to the pleurovac and the catheter sutured into place. Repeat fluoroscopic imaging showed pig tail in place and complete lung re-expansion. The patient was subsequently intubated and admitted to the IM service for chest tube management.

Medications: General Anesthesia, 

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 

Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was boggy and edematous consistent with chronic radiation bronchitis. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, there were thick non-purulent sections in multiple airways which were suctioned.  Following inspection the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Due to software issues the navigational catheter was mis-registering in relationship to the navigational map. We attempted to use manual registration and were able to navigate to the nodule based on the navigational software however a suboptimal image was seen when the radial EBUS was inserted through the ENB catheter. TBNAs were obtained and on ROSE showed lymphocytes which is unusual. Due to concern that registration led to inaccurate navigation we converted to conventional bronchoscopy. Using the P190 thin bronchoscope we advance into the area of interest based on imaging. A concentric EBUS view was seen however when we attempted to insert the super-dimension TBNA needle the needle stiffness made in difficult to enter the target airway.  We then attempted to use the therapeutic bronchoscope we navigated a sheath catheter into the segment of interest within the right lower lobe and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization yielded an eccentric view of the lesion. Similar issues with advancing the biopsy tools through the catheter were encountered and biopsies were suboptimal. We then attempted to again navigate to the nodule with the thin bronchoscope and were able to advance to the target airway and forceps biopsies were performed under fluoroscopic imagine.  After samples were obtained and we were confident that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.

Proceduralist: CDR Russell Miller MD 

Procedure: EBUS guided bronchoscopy  


Procedural Details:  

The patient provided informed consent for the procedure after receiving an explanation in lay terms about the indications, details of the procedure, potential risks, and alternatives. All questions were addressed, and informed consent was documented in accordance with institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were conducted, and the findings were updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed before the intervention. 

The patient received intravenous medications, as documented in the record, and topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree. The Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via a laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was properly positioned. The vocal cords appeared normal, and the subglottic space was unremarkable. The trachea had a normal caliber, and the carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. The bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal, with no endobronchial lesions or secretions observed. 

The Q190 video bronchoscope was removed, and the UC180F convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via the laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. 

A directed EBUS examination was performed to evaluate the abnormal lymph node that had been previously identified and biopsied as follows 

After identification of the 11Rs lymph node transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed using the 19-gauge and 21 gauge Olympus ViziShot 2 EBUS-TBNA needles . A total of eight biopsies were performed. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) yielded lymphocytes. 

After identification of the station 7 lymph node transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed using the 19-gauge and 21 gauge Olympus ViziShot 2 EBUS-TBNA needles . A total of eight biopsies were performed. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) yielded lymphocytes. 

After identification of the station 4R lymph node transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed using the 19-gauge Olympus ViziShot 2 EBUS-TBNA needle and ROSE yielded scant tissue from a single pass, and it was decided to return our focus to a more abnormal appearing node given known Hodgkin’s and higher yield with larger tissue samples.  

We then returned to the station 7 lymph node and created a tract with the 19-gauge Olympus ViziShot 2 EBUS-TBNA needle using the sheath to dilate the tract, the spybite mini-forceps were inserted through the tract and into the lymph node under EBUS guidance and tissue biopsies were obtained. A total of four tissue samples were obtained.   

Following the completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was re-inserted. After suctioning blood and secretions, no evidence of active bleeding was observed. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

 

 All TBNA samples were sent for routine cytology and mini-forceps sample were sent for histology.  

Complications: No immediate complications 

Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc 

 

Post Procedure Diagnosis: 

- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided needle and forceps biopsies. 

- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit. 

- Will await final pathology results

Proceduralist(s):

Procedure Name: Medical Thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with parietal pleural biopsies 

Indications: Left sided pleural effusion 

Medications: As per anesthesia record 

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had multiple simple appearing adhesions and small whitish plaques were seen along the posterior parietal pleural. The 5mm disposable primary port was then replaced with an 8mm disposable primary port via the same tract and optical cupped biopsy forceps were introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. After gentle lysis of simple adhesions with the blunt closed forceps, biopsies of the suspicious areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with rigid cupped forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, a 14 French pigtail catheter was inserted through the port site and attached to pleuro-vac with suction. After air evacuation with cessation of bubbling in pleuro-vac the chest tube was removed and the site sutured and dressed.  

Complications: None 

The patient tolerated the procedural well. 

Post-procedure chest radiograph showed full lung re-expansion with minimal residual pleural effusion.  

Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc 

Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion  

Recommendation: 

Discharge once post-op criteria met 

Will await pathology and microbiological studies

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: left mainstem stent obstruction 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  

Distal granulation tissue causing left lower lobe obstruction 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with cryodebulking/cryotherapy of obstructive granulation tissue, endobronchial submucosal steroid injection, left mainstem bronchial stent removal 

SURGEON: Robby Muller, MD  

ASSISTANT: Michael Myers DO (fellow)

INDICATIONS: complete lobar collapse   

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent.  

Sedation: General Anesthesia 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea and right sided airways were normal. The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of stent obstruction.  At the distal edge of the stent there was some minor granulation tissue which was nonobstructive.  Distal to the stent there was complete obstruction of the left lower lobe orifice secondary to granulation tissue.  Using the 1.9 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract granulation tissue to visualize the segmental stenosis in the left lower lobe.  All of the segments were obstructed with granulation tissue as well which we also removed with cryotherapy as well as flexible forceps.  At this point we decided to remove the left mainstem stent for a few reasons.  The first is that pathology from previous bronchoscopy at time of stent placement did not show evidence of tumor and metallic stents are not advised for benign disease.  The second was that her new obstruction was secondary to distal granulation tissue and it was unclear whether the stent was providing any current benefit.  Finally, our hope was that the short-term placement of the stent allowed some remodeling of the airway to relieve the previous obstruction.  At this point the LMA was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted and passed into the airway and advanced to the distal trachea and then attached to the jet ventilator. The flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the rigid bronchoscope into the airway.  Using flexible forceps to grasp the proximal string on the stent we were able to gently retract the stent and remove it without difficulty.  Subsequently they flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and as we had hoped the orifice had remodeled and essentially there is no obstruction at the level of the previous stent.  At the left of the LC2 carina (bifurcation between left upper and left lower lobe) the left upper lobe stump from previous lobectomy appeared intact.  Then, using a 8–9–10 millimeter CRE balloon dilated each of the left lower lobe subsegments as well as the left lower lobe main bronchus which improved patency of the subsegments to approximately 50% of normal and left lower lobe bronchus to approximately 80%.  Cryotherapy was then performed with 30 second freeze/thaw cycles to induce tissue sloughing.  Finally using the super dimension 21-gauge needle we injected a total of 5 mL of Kenalog 10 mg/milliliter solution into the submucosa have areas of significant granulation tissue in hopes of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect to prevent regrowth of granulation tissue.  

Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the case was turned over to anesthesia to recover the patient.  

Recommendations: 

Transfer patient back to the ICU

Procedure Name: Inspection bronchoscopy with bronchial lavage 

Indications: Right lower lobe collapse and possible BP fistula 

Medications: General Anesthesia 

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs  

Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.  The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. The left sided airways were normal.  Significant pus was encountered within the right mainstem which was suctioned.  Once we’re able to better visualize the airways a 3 mm hole consistent with the BP fistula actively oozing purulent material was seen in the stump from the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  A proximally 150 cc of gross pus was suctioned including 40 cc which was suctioned and retained in the trap for culture.  The right middle lobe stump was intact.  The superior segment of the right lower lobe was open.  The basilar segments of the right lower lobe were completely obstructed due to bronchial kink without endobronchial disease which we could not pass.  Purulent material was expressed from this area as well consistent with a postobstructive pneumonia.  CT surgery was informed of the findings and came to the room to observe the stump.  At this point retained secretions were suctioned and once we were confident that there was no evidence of active bleeding the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.  

Complications: None  

Estimated Blood Loss: 0 

 

Post Procedure Diagnosis: 

- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with bronchial wash. 

-BP fistula in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe stump.

Procedure(s) Performed: 
Indications: right lower lobe nodule
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered 
and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were 
performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs 
were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and 
tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. 
The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was boggy and edematous consistent with chronic 
radiation bronchitis. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. 
Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, there were thick nonpurulent sections in multiple airways which were suctioned. Following inspection the super-dimension 
navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. 
Due to software issues the navigational catheter was mis-registering in relationship to the navigational 
map. We attempted to use manual registration and were able to navigate to the nodule based on the 
navigational software however a suboptimal image was seen when the radial EBUS was inserted through 
the ENB catheter. TBNAs were obtained and on ROSE showed lymphocytes which is unusual. Due to 
concern that registration led to inaccurate navigation we converted to conventional bronchoscopy.
Using the P190 thin bronchoscope we advance into the area of interest based on imaging. A concentric 
EBUS view was seen however when we attempted to insert the super-dimension TBNA needle the 
needle stiffness made in difficult to enter the target airway. We then attempted to use the therapeutic 
bronchoscope we navigated a sheath catheter into the segment of interest within the right lower lobe 
and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization 
yielded an eccentric view of the lesion. Similar issues with advancing the biopsy tools through the 
catheter were encountered and biopsies were suboptimal. We then attempted to again navigate to the 
nodule with the thin bronchoscope and were able to advance to the target airway and forceps biopsies 
were performed under fluoroscopic imagine. After samples were obtained and we were confident that 
there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.
Complications: No immediate complications

Procedure(s) Performed: 
Indications: right lower lobe nodule
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered 
and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were 
performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs 
were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and 
tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. 
The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was boggy and edematous consistent with chronic 
radiation bronchitis. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. 
Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, there were thick nonpurulent sections in multiple airways which were suctioned. Following inspection the super-dimension 
navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. 
Due to software issues the navigational catheter was mis-registering in relationship to the navigational 
map. We attempted to use manual registration and were able to navigate to the nodule based on the 
navigational software however a suboptimal image was seen when the radial EBUS was inserted through 
the ENB catheter. TBNAs were obtained and on ROSE showed lymphocytes which is unusual. Due to 
concern that registration led to inaccurate navigation we converted to conventional bronchoscopy.
Using the P190 thin bronchoscope we advance into the area of interest based on imaging. A concentric 
EBUS view was seen however when we attempted to insert the super-dimension TBNA needle the 
needle stiffness made in difficult to enter the target airway. We then attempted to use the therapeutic 
bronchoscope we navigated a sheath catheter into the segment of interest within the right lower lobe 
and peripheral radial probe was inserted into the catheter to confirm location. Ultrasound visualization 
yielded an eccentric view of the lesion. Similar issues with advancing the biopsy tools through the 
catheter were encountered and biopsies were suboptimal. We then attempted to again navigate to the 
nodule with the thin bronchoscope and were able to advance to the target airway and forceps biopsies 
were performed under fluoroscopic imagine. After samples were obtained and we were confident that 
there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure concluded.
Complications: No immediate complications

Procedure Name: Medical Thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with parietal pleural biopsies

Indications: Left sided pleural effusion

Medications: As per anesthesia record

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had multiple simple appearing adhesions and small whitish plaques were seen along the posterior parietal pleural. The 5mm disposable primary port was then replaced with an 8mm disposable primary port via the same tract and optical cupped biopsy forceps were introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. After gentle lysis of simple adhesions with the blunt closed forceps, biopsies of the suspicious areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with rigid cupped forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, a 14 French pigtail catheter was inserted through the port site and attached to pleuro-vac with suction. After air evacuation with cessation of bubbling in pleuro-vac the chest tube was removed and the site sutured and dressed.  

Complications: None

The patient tolerated the procedural well.

Post-procedure chest radiograph showed full lung re-expansion with minimal residual pleural effusion.  

Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc

Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion  

Recommendation:

Discharge once post-op criteria met

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: lung cancer endobronchial tumor obstruction of trachea and right mainstem  

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Resolved airway obstruction s/p silicone Y-stent 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and silicone tracheobronchial Y- stent placement  

SURGEON: Jim Maybee, MD 

INDICATIONS: Airway obstruction/hemoptysis 

Consent was obtained from the family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent. 

Sedation: General Anesthesia 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the posterior oropharynx. The ETT was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced past the vocal cords into the mid trachea and connected to ventilator. Airway inspection was performed using the T190 theraputic flexible bronchoscope. The upper trachea was normal. The mid trachea had friable tumor mostly at the posterior wall causing about 30% airway obstruction. The distal trachea had extensive tumor predominantly involving the right lateral and posterior wall and extending into the carina. The very proximal left mainstem was partially obstructed from tumor infiltration of the main carina. Beyond this area the left mainstem, left upper and left lower lobe appeared normal without tumor involvement. At the proximal aspect of the right mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing near complete obstruction (95%).  Tumor extraction was performed using APC and flexible forceps to “burn and shave” the tumor within the trachea and proximal right mainstem. Once we were able to open the right mainstem up to the point that we could inspect the more distal airways we found extensive circumferential tumor infiltration extending to about 5mm distal to the right upper lobe. Distally from that point there was no evidence of tumor infiltration. There was extensive tumor within the right upper lobe. We debulked the right mainstem and proximal BI area in a similar fashion. We could not make out tissue plains as the tumor had completely infiltrated the airways. We were able to achieve about 85% opening of the distal tracheal and 50% opening of the right mainstem. At this point due to significant residual disease and fear that further debulking could result in airway perforation given that the airway tissue planes were completely lost from tumor infiltration the decision was made to place a silicone Y-stent for both improved patency and to prevent tumor ingrowth. We also decided to extend stent beyond right upper lobe and “jail” the lobe due to tumor extension from within the right upper lobe which extended into the proximal bronchus intermedius. After measuring the airways we customized a 15x12x12 silicone Y-stent to a length of 80mm in the tracheal limb, 30mm in the right mainstem limb and 30mm in the left mainstem limb. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and a 13mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope (required for Y-stent insertion) was inserted through the cords and advanced into the proximal left mainstem and the stent was deployed. Through the use of rigid forceps, and manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we attempted to seed the stent in place however there was significant difficultly getting the right sided limb past the carinal infiltrative tumor and at one point the stent was noted to tear in the right sided limb. We then removed the stent and inserted another stent of the same size using the same technique. Again it was extremely difficult to get the stent to seed into proper position however after manipulating the stent with rigid forceps and by manipulation with the tip of the flexible bronchoscope we were eventually able to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway.  At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. Due to the prolonged nature of the procedure decision was made to intubate the patient prior to transfer back to the ICU. We then removed the rigid bronchoscope and inserted a 7.0 ETT into the airway over a flexible bronchoscope to allow for visualization of the distal tip and directed the tip of the ETT into the proximal limb of the stent (about 2.5 cm into the stent) inflated the pilot balloon and secured the ETT in place. At this point the procedure was completed and the case was turned over to anesthesia.  

 

Recommendations: 

-          Transfer back to ICU 

-          Post-procedure x-ray 

-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance. 

-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified 

-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge. 

-           Extubation must be performed with flexible bronchoscope to allow visualization of the stent and using flexible forceps to apply downward pressure on the main carina while retracting the ETT to avoid dislodging of the stent.  

-	If invasive ventilatory support is required after ETT removal blind intubation (direct laryngoscopy, glidescope) should be avoided as it can result in dislodgment of the tracheal stent and potential catastrophic airway obstruction.  Intubation should be performed with a 7.0 or smaller ETT with bronchoscopic insertion to visualize the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube should be advanced approximately 3 cm into the tracheal limb of the stent and secured.

Your extraction gave:

bronch_location_lobe: RUL

Why?

Because the narrative includes a section:

“There was extensive tumor within the right upper lobe.”

Your model saw “right upper lobe” → matched to lobe → inserted RUL, even though this case is rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking and Y-stent, not a diagnostic bronchoscopy targeting a lobe.

This is not what bronch_location_lobe is meant to capture for CAO/debulking/stent procedures.

Why this is incorrect for this procedure

For this case:

The bronchoscopy procedure is central airway tumor debulking + Y-stent placement

No biopsies or BAL were performed in RUL

The RUL was not accessed for sampling

The RUL was deliberately jailed by the stent, not treated directly

Therefore:

bronch_location_lobe should be null for this note.

The appropriate place to capture tumor involvement is:

lesion_location

cao_location

cao_interventions (locations)

stent_location

Which were already populated correctly.

Recommended fix for your extractor

Add logic to ensure bronch_location_lobe is only populated if there is a diagnostic-type action targeting a lobe, such as:

BAL / lavage

Brushings

Washings (if lobar)

Transbronchial biopsies

Navigational bronchoscopy target lobe

Cryobiopsy

Peripheral ablation

AND require a nearby action verb like:

“BAL performed in…”
“Biopsies were taken from…”
“Lavaged the…”
“Sampled the…”
“Bronchoalveolar lavage in…”
“Biopsy obtained from…”

For CAO/debulking/stent notes, skip this field entirely.

Suggested rule (pseudo-logic)
IF procedure_family ∈ {CAO, STENT, TRACHEA, RIGID}
    THEN set bronch_location_lobe = null
ELSE IF text contains (lobe_name) AND 
        nearby (biopsy|BAL|lavage|brushing|sampling|cryobiopsy|navigation)
    THEN populate lobe
ELSE
    leave null
