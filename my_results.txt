NOTE_ID:  note_274 SOURCE_FILE: note_274.txt 
DATE OF PROCEDURE: 
[REDACTED]
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure and recurrent hemoptysis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required increased time and effort for selective fiberoptic intubation of the right-sided airways and manipulation/revision of the vascular plug. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     . 
ATTENDING:  
[REDACTED]
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Copious secretions noted throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: LUL with vascular plug in place with overlying mucus. Vascular plug noted not to be completely occlusing LUL airways with gap at the 10 o'clock position. Copious thick and thin secretions throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Copious thick and thin secretions throughout.  
DISTAL LUL AIRWAYS VISIBLE PAST VASCULAR PLUG

 

 

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus. 
Fiberoptic intubation via oral pathway was performed to introduce a 5.0 MLT ETT into the right mainstem bronchus, thus securing ventilation to the right-sided airways in case of hemoptysis. This was done due to high risk of bleeding from the LUL known aspergilloma
Next, pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the vascular plug and bring it more proximally and ensure complete occlusion of the LUL.
VIEW OF VASCULAR PLUG AFTER REVISION

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of vascular plug at the LUL. The vascular plug was found to not be fully occluding the airway. Pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the plug and pull it proximally into a position allowing for complete occlusion of the LUL.
--CT chest now to eval non-visible sections of the vascular plug and assess possibility of future migration
--Continued care per primary team

NOTE_ID: note_327	SOURCE_FILE: note_327.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 60 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31623 Dx bronchoscope/brushing    
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local ONLY
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   <5mL
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
The flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted into the LMA and advanced to the carina. Bilateral airway inspection taken to the segmental level showed the trachea was of normal calibre. The carina was sharp. The right anastomosis looked patent. The left mainstem anastomosis had good patency due to a metallic stent in good position in left mainstem. The stent was impacted with mucous. There was normal anatomic branching to segmental level. There were no endobronchial lesions. There were no mucosal abnormalities.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Left mainstem.  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Endobronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush at left mainstem.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Left Mainstem from mucus plug. 
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 
Left mainstem wash
Left mainstem brush
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 60 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for stent inspection.
[ ] repeat bronch in 2-4 weeks. At two weeks stent patency was good. There was no significant granulation tissue ingrowth, there was moderate amount of mucous impaction. Could stick with two week inspection or could stretch to 4 weeks.
[ ] continue stent hydration protocol at current frequency.

MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. Thick mucus and plugs were noted throughout the airway. These were suctioned.
 
The left lower lobe superior segment came off in the left mainstem and the right upper lobe had early bifurcation. 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:

Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	 	300	15	100	10.25	20
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2).  Target lesion is about 1.5 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 8 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, mucus plug, and blood. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical Segment of RUL (RB1), Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2), and Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 2: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 1 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 3 elastographic pattern, predominantly stiff (blue), raising concern for malignancy. Based on this finding, the lymph node was prioritized for TBNA with multiple passes obtained to maximize diagnostic yield.
 
Site 3: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken
 
Site 4: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 5: The 11Ri lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, mucus plug, blood, and blood clots. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 58 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to EGD and PEG tube placement were discussed with the patient or surrogate decision-maker in detail.  Patient or surrogate decision-maker indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
PROCEDURE:  
43246 Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, flexible, transoral; with directed placement of percutaneous gastrostomy tube

 
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided (concurrent with tracheostomy placement):
Versed             3 mg
Fentanyl          100 mcg
Etomidate20mg
Rocuronium80mg
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   1600
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   1829
Total moderate sedation time was 149 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by ICU RN. 
 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Under sterile prep and draping, the abdomen was evaluated and 2 cm below the costal margin on the left, the likely point of insertion was identified. 
The scope was introduced through the mouth without difficulty and with continuous insufflation, the stomach was reached within 10 seconds. Then, the point of digital pressure was identified in the stomach and transillumination was accomplished successfully and without any doubts. 
At this point, a 1cm incision was carried out in the skin and a 14ga angiocath was introduced. Using modified Seldinger technique, the angiocath was advanced and a wire was introduced. Using pull through technique, the guide wire was pulled through the mouth and linked to the 20Fr PEG catheter in usual fashion. Thereafter, the wire was pulled through the abdominal wall and the PEG tube positioned correctly with the bumper at 4.5 cm. The remaining air was suctioned out and complete apposition of the stomach and esophagus was seen. There were no complications. 
The total procedural time was 28 minutes.
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
PEG can be used for medications 6 hrs post procedure (@2320)
PEG (or NG tube) can be used for feeds 6 hrs post procedure (@2320). No enteral feeding prior.
OK to restart systemic anticoagulation @2320, if needed.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 58 year old-year-old male who presents for EGD and Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy tube placement. Patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--PEG can be used for medications 6 hrs post procedure (@2320)
--PEG (or NG tube) can be used for feeds 6 hrs post procedure (@2320). No enteral feeding prior.
--OK to restart systemic anticoagulation @2320, if needed.
--If required to place gauze underneath the skin bumper, please use only 1 thin layer and change as needed, as this can lead to tension on the gastric cuff and result in complication.
--Please call the Interventional pulmonary fellow on call should there be any issues with the PEG.

The airway was inspected. Lidocaine was applied. The trachea and right lung were normal appearing. The left upper lobe was stretched. The left lower lobe had valves in place with mucus noted. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
The left lower lobe was irrigated and washed with multiple rounds of saline. This was suctioned.
 
Alligator forceps were used to remove each of the valves, there were five valves identified and these were each removed. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 30 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, mucus plug, and blood. 
 
Some granulation tissue was noted at the left lower lobe superior segment. This was excised with alligator forceps.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. The vocal cords were normal appearing. Lidocaine was applied to the airway.
 
The right anastomosis site was intact and normal appearing. 
 
The left anastomosis site had narrowing and the scope was unable to pass it. Saline was used to irrigate the left lung and clear secretions. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Vocal Cord, Subglottic, Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left mainstem.  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm to 9 mm 10 mm at the left mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left mainstem.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm to 11 mm to 12 mm at the left mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
 

Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7 mm	 	30 second circumferential freeze	 
 
Prior to treatment and dilation, affected airway was note to be 50% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. 
 
 
The following stent (microtech 12x30 mm) was placed in the left mainstem. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Left lower lobe BAL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stenosis.
 
-Follow up bronchoscopy in 3-6 weeks
-Stent hydration with nebulizer at home

NOTE_ID: note_344	SOURCE_FILE: note_344.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis of left mainstem bronchus after transplant.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
 
General Anesthesia

ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:    <5mL
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted into the LMA and advanced to the carina. Bilateral airway inspection showed anastomosis on right was intact. No significant obstruction by granulation tissue. There was normal anatomic branching on right. Similarly left anastomosis was seen.  Stent was 60% obstructed with mucous. Once this was cleared the left mainstem was able traversed and inspected and there was normal anatomic branching. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at  Left mainstem .  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the  Left mainstem  from mucus plug. Sample sent for cell count and culture.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 
L mainstem BAL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for stent inspection. Stent place 1/5.  On 1/19 had been plugged by mucous, added guaifenisin and flutter valve to his regimen. He was planned for another bronch in 2-3 weeks, original plan of 4-6 weeks is too long based on how this stent appeared during last bronch. 
 
[ ] follow up cultures from mucous. 
[ ] repeat bronch in 2-3 weeks for stent evaluation

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. The vocal cords were normal appearing. 
 
The subglottis and trachea were inspected and the previous tracheostomy site was noted. There was minimal extraneous tissue in the area.
 
The remainder of the airway was inspected with normal appearing anatomy bilaterally with some malacia noted and normal appearing mucosa. 
 
There were some secretions noted throughout the airway and these were suctioned and cleared.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Transbronchial Cryo biopsies. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Technical difficulty of procedure and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31628 TBBX single lobe     . 

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	325	12	100	10	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is not visible.  The following features were noted: snow-storm.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 2 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 10 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was not performed as non-met biopsy criteria. .
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 80 year old-year-old male who presents with Recurrent Effusion.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound, Tunnel Pleural Catheter Placement, and Thoracoscopy with biopsy and chemical pleurodesis were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32609 Thoracoscopy; with biopsy(ies) of pleura
32650 Thoracoscopy, surgical; with pleurodesis (eg, mechanical or chemical)
 
SEDATION: MAC per Anesthesia
  
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.

PROCEDURE FINDINGS: 
A time-out was performed in which the patient, operative procedure and operative sites were confirmed among with the nursing, surgical and anesthesia teams.  
 
The skin and underlying tissue at the proposed trocar insertion site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. A skin incision of approximately 1cm was made in the 6th intercostal space in the posterior axillary line. The pleural space was accessed under direct visualization using the rigid pleuroscope with optical trocar over the superior border of the lower rib to avoid neuromuscular bundle injury.
 
Initial thoracoscopic survey demonstrates no nodularity along the anterior or posterior chest wall no atop the diaphragm. There is some anthracotic pigment atop the diaphragm and at the visualized lung. Biopsies of the posterior chest wall/parietal pleura were obtained with the use of the cupped and curved rigid forceps.

INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. Lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the airway. The vocal cords were normal appearing.
 
The stent remained in good position, there was still some over hang at the main carina. The right mainstem, right upper lobe, and the right bronchus intermedius stent segments were patent in the Y stent. There were secretions and these were suctioned.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED]is a 50 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stent inspection.
 
-Follow up in clinic to reassess symptoms and plan for follow up bronchoscopy in 4-8 weeks for stent check

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Entire airway normal (via ETT)
The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. Airway exam notable for mild mucus/secretions bilaterally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	300	12	10	100	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Blizzard Sign (GGO).
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
The robotic catheter was then advanced near the newly segmented lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Images showed tool-in-lesion. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 

 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 7 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage (mini-BAL) was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical Segment of RUL (RB1), Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2), and Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Inflammatory cells; No evidence of a malignant neoplasm
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID: note_335	SOURCE_FILE: note_335.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31623 Dx bronchoscope/brushing    
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    

 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for LMSB stent (12x40 microtech) well-seated, moderately obstructed my mucus. Widely patent airways distal to stent in left lung. 
Large burden cream-colored secretions bilaterally, L > R. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Endobronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the working channel of the scope. The brush was used to clean the inside of the stent and remove adherent mucus.  Total 2 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- Lingula BAL 
- LMSB brushing 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial stenosis.
 
- f/u studies
- increase stent hydration therapy to minimum BID- discussed with wife
- repeat stent inspection bronch in 6 weeks

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 73 year old-year-old male who presents with lung mass.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at LB9 was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	Knife	preciSECT 4	resection	Removed tumor
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 80% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Tumor LB9 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 73 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for endobronchial lung mass.
- f/u in clinic (consider PDT in the future)

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED]is a 45 year old-year-old female who presents with lung nodule and lymphadenopathy.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R59.0 Localized enlarged lymph nodes
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R59.0 Localized enlarged lymph nodes
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31652 EBUS sampling 1 or 2 nodes
76982 Ultrasound Elastography, First Target Lesion
76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Targets 
76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Target 2
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Multiple Bronchoalveolar lavages in different locations. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Increased intensity, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    . 

 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 21-gauge Needle and 19-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
10R lymph node
10L lymph node
11Rs lymph node
11L lymph node
 
Overall ROSE Diagnosis: inflammation
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Inflamation. Final results are pending.
 
Site 2-5: station 4R, 7, 11L, 11R, 10R Elastography and measurements were done but none met biopsy criteria and showed benign features on elastography. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. Lidocaine was applied to the airway.
 
The trachea, left lung, right upper lobe, and right middle lobe were normal appearing except for patches of anthracosis throughout the airway.
 
The right lower lobe superior segment was completely obstructed by tumor. 
Narrowband imaging was used to inspect the airway and tumor, no excess blood vascularity was noted. 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
Left upper lobe mass and Right lower lobe mass
 
Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Positive for malignancy
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of anthracosis. Final results are pending.
 
Site 2: The left upper lobe mass was => 10 mm on CT and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 8 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 3 elastographic pattern, predominantly stiff (blue), raising concern for malignancy. Based on this finding, the lymph node was prioritized for TBNA with multiple passes obtained to maximize diagnostic yield.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.
 
Site 3: The 11Ri lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 5 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as not adequate and suggestive of Specimen was inadequate for ROSE analysis . Final results are pending.
 
Site 4: The Right lower lobe mass was => 10 mm on CT and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.
 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at right lower lobe superior segment was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.1 mm	 	5-15 seconds	Cryo adhesion and ablation
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 100% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 80% patent. 
 
After tumor ablation, the airway was probed with forceps and dilated. Thick mucus was irrigated and suctioned out. 
 
The airways beyond were distorted.
 
Alligator forceps were used to perform further excision at the right lower lobe superior segment. 
 
Iced saline was used to control bleeding.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2), Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3), Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4), and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID: note_345	SOURCE_FILE: note_345.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
An iGel was introduced by anesthesia. Next the bronchoscope was introduced into the iGel and advanced to the level of the vocal cords. The vocal cords are normal. A total of 6 mL of 1% lidocaine was instilled onto the vocal cords. The bronchoscope was advanced through the vocal cords into the trachea. The airways were examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
The Right anastomosis is intact with minimal narrowing along the 1 oclock position. The clip is still present without granulation tissue
 
The left anastomosis is scarred to approximately 11-12 mm and the bronchoscope easily advanced distal to this. There is a short segment of stenosis just proximal to the left hilum. The therapeutic bronchoscope could not easily traverse this stenosis. The diameter was ~ 5-6 mm. 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 4 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 

Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7	30 second rapid freeze thaw cycles	Total of 6 applications were performed	Improvement in airway diameter and able to accommodate the scope 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 50% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 70% patent. 
There were no post obstructive mucus. The LUL anterior subsegmental airway was narrowed due to collapse of the supportive structure
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL LUL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for worsening dyspnea after stent removed. Pt with improvement after starting pulmonary toilet regimen. 
- plan for follow up in clinic in 2-3 weeks
Continue pulmonary toilet

INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
DATE OF PROCEDURE: 
 [REDACTED]
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required increased time and effort for selective fiberoptic intubation of the right-sided airways and manipulation/revision of the vascular plug. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     . 
ATTENDING:  
[REDACTED]
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
Dexmedetomidine gtt  1.5mcg/kg/h
Propofol gtt                  20mcg/kg/min
Dilaudid gtt                  4mg/h
Vecuronium gtt9mg/h
Midazolam gtt              8mg/h
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Copious secretions noted throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: LUL with vascular plug in place with overlying mucus. Copious thick and thin secretions throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Copious thick and thin secretions throughout.  
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood clots. 
Fiberoptic intubation via oral pathway was performed to introduce a 5.0 MLT ETT into the right mainstem bronchus, thus securing ventilation to the right-sided airways in case of hemoptysis. This was done due to high risk of bleeding from the LUL known aspergilloma 
Pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the vascular plug and bring it more proximally and ensure complete occlusion of the LUL. 
VIEW OF VASCULAR PLUG AFTER REVISION 

 

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchoscopy for evaluation of vascular plug at the LUL. Pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the plug and pull it proximally into a position allowing for complete occlusion of the LUL with less likelihood for migration.
--Initiation of awakening trials, sedation weaning
--Daily bronchoscopies for now to eval vascular plug/hemoptysis
--Gentle in-line suctioning
--Continued care per primary team

NOTE_ID: note_309	SOURCE_FILE: note_309.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 62 year old-year-old female who presents with chronic cough and abnormal CT.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: chronic cough
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  chronic cough
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
  
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
 
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Versed             2.5 mg
Fentanyl          75 mcg
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   09:09
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   09:24
 
Total moderate sedation time was 15 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by Matt Reed, RN. 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
After adequate sedation the bronchoscope was introduced into the mouth and advanced to the level of the epiglottis. A total of 6 mL of 2% lidocaine was instilled for topical anesthesia. The vocal cords are normal in structure and function. The bronchoscope was advanced through the vocal cords into the trachea. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. The mucosa was normal. The RML was mildly narrowed and the mucosa of the RML was friable. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the RML, distal BI, RLL superior segment from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
There was no active bleeding
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL RML
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 62 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for chronic cough and abnormal CT chest.
