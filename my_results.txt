ASSISTANT:   -
 
Support Staff: 
RN: [Redacted]
RT: [Redacted]
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. The vocal cords were normal appearing. 
 
The subglottis and trachea were inspected and the previous tracheostomy site was noted. There was minimal extraneous tissue in the area.
 
The remainder of the airway was inspected with normal appearing anatomy bilaterally with some malacia noted and normal appearing mucosa. 
 
There were some secretions noted throughout the airway and these were suctioned and cleared.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [Redacted] is a 74 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for tracheal stenosis.
 
-Plan for follow up bronchoscopy in 3-6 months to reassess the site of stenosis

31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31630 Balloon dilation. 
  
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    Valve placement aborted due to airway findings
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. The vocal cords were normal appearing. The trachea and right lung were normal appearing. The left upper lobe was normal appearing. 
 
The left lower lobe had some scaring from previous valve placements. The left lower lobe anterior and medial segments were scarred. The anterior basilar segment was >90% obstructed and the Medial segment was >50% scarred.
 
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at left lower lobe anterior basilar segment.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at left lower lobe medial basilar segment.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left lower lobe anterior basilar segment.  Mustang balloon was used to perform dilation to 4 mm at the left lower lobe anterior basilar segment.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left lower lobe medial basilar segment.  Mustang balloon was used to perform dilation to 4 mm at the left lower lobe medial basilar segment.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Endobronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush at left lower lobe anterior basilar segment.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Endobronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush at left lower lobe lateral basilar segment.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID: note_315	SOURCE_FILE: note_315.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 73 year old-year-old male who presents with lung mass.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at LB9 was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	Knife	preciSECT 4	resection	Removed tumor
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 80% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Tumor LB9 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 73 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for endobronchial lung mass.
- f/u in clinic (consider PDT in the future)

NOTE_ID:  note_274 SOURCE_FILE: note_274.txt 
DATE OF PROCEDURE: 
[REDACTED]
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure and recurrent hemoptysis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required increased time and effort for selective fiberoptic intubation of the right-sided airways and manipulation/revision of the vascular plug. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     . 
ATTENDING:  
[REDACTED]
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Copious secretions noted throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: LUL with vascular plug in place with overlying mucus. Vascular plug noted not to be completely occlusing LUL airways with gap at the 10 o'clock position. Copious thick and thin secretions throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Copious thick and thin secretions throughout.  
DISTAL LUL AIRWAYS VISIBLE PAST VASCULAR PLUG

 

 

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus. 
Fiberoptic intubation via oral pathway was performed to introduce a 5.0 MLT ETT into the right mainstem bronchus, thus securing ventilation to the right-sided airways in case of hemoptysis. This was done due to high risk of bleeding from the LUL known aspergilloma
Next, pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the vascular plug and bring it more proximally and ensure complete occlusion of the LUL.
VIEW OF VASCULAR PLUG AFTER REVISION

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of vascular plug at the LUL. The vascular plug was found to not be fully occluding the airway. Pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the plug and pull it proximally into a position allowing for complete occlusion of the LUL.
--CT chest now to eval non-visible sections of the vascular plug and assess possibility of future migration
--Continued care per primary team

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 60 year old-year-old male who presents with lung .  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
 
 
General Anesthesia

RT: Juliet Barnia
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
There were significant malacia noted in LMS about 2cm from the main carina.  After traversing through this, the stent was noted to be in good position.  Lightly covered by mucus. 
 
Bronchial washing was performed at Left Mainstem.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Washing
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 60 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for stent evaluation.
 
- completed - return for bronch evaluation in 6 weeks
- consider longer stent in discussion with lung transplant

NOTE_ID: note_313	SOURCE_FILE: note_313.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 73 year old-year-old male who presents with airway stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
31899NFD BRONCHOSCOPY W/ APPLICATION OF TRANEXAMIC ACID
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required) and 82 Surgical assistance provided by an attending when a qualified resident physician was not available. 
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a significant tumor debulking and ablation. This resulted in >80% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). 
  
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Patient was intubated with ardnt 7fr blocker and 8.0 ET tube.   Blocker was placed outside of ET tube and was inflated to 6cc to complete block off the airway. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at LB 9 was treated with the following modalities:
 

Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	snare	Force coag 4	5 secs	Removed part of tumor
APC	1.5mm	Forced 4	10secs	Coagulated tumor
MWA	minicatheter	90oC	3, 3, 3, 5, 2, 3 minutes	Tumor ablated
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 0% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
 
Blocker was intermittently inflated to achieve hemostasis. 
 
10cc of TXA and 10cc of EPI was instilled in 2 cc aliquots for a total of 5 times.  Ice saline was instilled (>150cc) to achieve hemostasis. 
 
Significant effort, time, intensity was used to achieve complete opening of the airway with very bleedy tumor.   
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Tumor 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 73 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for tumor debulking and ablation.
- monitor overnight for repeat bleeding
- consider short term bronch in 2-7 days.

NOTE_ID: note_337	SOURCE_FILE: note_337.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. The vocal cords were normal appearing. Lidocaine was applied to the airway.
 
The right anastomosis site was intact and normal appearing. 
 
The left anastomosis site had narrowing and the scope was unable to pass it. Saline was used to irrigate the left lung and clear secretions. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Vocal Cord, Subglottic, Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left mainstem.  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm to 9 mm 10 mm at the left mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left mainstem.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm to 11 mm to 12 mm at the left mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
 

Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7 mm	 	30 second circumferential freeze	 
 
Prior to treatment and dilation, affected airway was note to be 50% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. 
 
 
The following stent (microtech 12x30 mm) was placed in the left mainstem. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Left lower lobe BAL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stenosis.
 
-Follow up bronchoscopy in 3-6 weeks
-Stent hydration with nebulizer at home

IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure (22 MODIFIER):
This patient required multiple modalities for relief of stenosis - including dilation with the rigid tracheoscope barrel and balloon dilation.  The patient required cryospray, which necessitates increased personnel and resource support in the OR in order to safely perform and unusual clinical expertise. This resulted in >80% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to:

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Bronchoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Mild
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Normal.
Larynx: Normal.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: : On initial evaluation the patient was noted to have mucus collected at the subglottic space. There was a very small diverticula noted at the anterior mid-trachea - at approximately 12 o'clock location. Additionally, there were multiple areas of stenosis along the trachea with the narrowest region at the distal 1/3 such that the therapeutic scope was unable to be passed across the stenosis.  There was a slight ridge of tissue at the 7-8 o'clock location - this ridge was improved from previous.  Balloon dilation was performed (see below) which allowed the bronchoscope to traverse past the distal tracheal stenosis and assess the remaining airways 
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Friable
Secretions: Moderate thick and thin secretions/mucus
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, left lower lobe from mucus. 
 
MUCUS AT SUBGLOTTIC SPACE

 
DIVERTICULA AT ANTERIOR MID TRACHEA

 
STENOSIS AT DISTAL TRACHEA

 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Bronchial washing was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
After induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black rigid short non-ventilating tracheoscope barrel (12.00 - 11.00 mm) was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth. The patient was noted to have a very mobile epiglottis and tight oropharynx making intubation with the tracheoscope challenging but not insurmountable.  The vocal cords were identified and the rigid tracheoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them. Once the rigid tracheoscope was positioned at the proximal-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed.
 
Due to stenosis, further advanced of the rigid tracheoscope was challenging without causing mucosal trauma - which we wanted to avoid in hopes of treating with cryospray.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Proximal 1/3).  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
The rigid tracheoscope was then advanced further into the proximal trachea and into the distal trachea.  
Dilation was performed using the rigid tracheoscope of the proximal trachea and mid-trachea.  The rigid tracheoscope was used to perform dilation to 12 mm in the proximal trachea and rigid trachea.  This was a single dilation that was performed for 10+ minutes.  While dilating 
 
Cryospray was then performed at the distal tracheal stenosis causing endotracheal/endobronchial obstruction as follows:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Cryospray cryotherapy	STERIS CryoSpray catheter 	Low-flow	10-second applications x 6 cycles.  
Despite priming outside of the airway, application of cryospray was limited by repeat chest rise.  Only one of these cycles was a complete 10-second treatment.  Most cycles lasted 5-8 seconds. Therefore, additional cycles performed at the site to compensate for the shortened durations. 	Overall, good application of spray cryotherapy to the area of distal tracheal stenosis.
 
Patient also with prolonged episodes of hypoxia after each cryospray treatment, especially when treatments performed close together (when allowing only for the standard 1 minute between treatments).  This improved with increasing Jet ventilation driving pressure from 24 --> 28 --> 30.  Likely related to reduced air flow/ventilation past the area of distal stenosis.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 13.5 mm and 15 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds and 60 seconds, respectively.
 
After dilation, there was a mild mucosal tear without perforation was noted at the left postero-lateral aspect of the distal trachea (7 o'clock to 8 o'clock region).  This area had mild oozing of blood - Nashville Grade II bleeding.  This was treated with a combination of cold saline and Epinephrine (total 0.4mg).
 
DISTAL TRACHEAL STENOSIS AT CONCLUSION OF PROCEDURE

 

 

 
Prior to treatment, the distal trachea airway was note to be 40% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 80% patent.  
 
Rigid bronchoscope was extubated.  LMA replaced by anesthesia team.  Flexible therapeutic bronchoscope advanced again - confirmed no injury to the vocal cords proxima or mid trachea from the rigid scope.
 
Residual secretions, saline, and minimal blood suctioned to clear.  No active bleeding.  Flexible bronchoscope was removed.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Transbronchial Cryo biopsies. This resulted in >50% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31628 TBBX single lobe     . 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level.
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:

Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	 	300	12	100	10	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Target lesion is about 2 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is eccentric, concentric after biopsies.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Cells present causing suspicion of malignant neoplasm
 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2), Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3), Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4), and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 3: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 4: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions.
