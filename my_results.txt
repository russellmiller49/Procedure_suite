IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a extensive ablation and debulking with excision along the left mainstem and left lower lobe with multiple dilations and multiple episodes of excision between other therapeutic modalities. This resulted in >90% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The airway was inspected. The trachea and right lung were intact and appropriate to the segmental level. The left mainstem was inflamed and the left upper lobe was visualized, but the left lower lobe was again not visualized.
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	 	300	12	100	10	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the left lower lobe presumed oriface.  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the target is not well visuzlized.  The following features were noted: soft tissue.
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of target location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
The target airway was visualized and targets were placed ensure optimal trajectory of the tools to open the obstructed airway.
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 19G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 2 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with precisor the extended working channel catheter.  Total 2 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
The robotic bronchoscope was advanced until airway lumen was visualized with the vision probe. The catheter was then drawn back and the robotic bronchoscope was disconnected. 
The therapeutic bronchoscope was then used to clear the airway. The left lung was irrigated with saline.
Granulation tissue and inflamed tissue was excised with the precisor, pulmonary, and large forceps. 
Balloon dilation was performed at left lower lobe orifice.  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the left lower lobe orifice.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Balloon dilation was performed at left lower lobe orifice.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the left lower lobe orifice.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
The left upper lobe and the left lower lobe were better visualized. 
Serial irrigation with iced saline was performed with excision of granulation tissue and blood clot/foreign body.
The 2.5 cm microwave catheter was used to ablate the inflamed tissue for three minutes(3.5KJ and 67 degrees Celsius reached), then a pause for further and extensive excision, followed by one minute (1.3 KJ and 49 degrees Celsius reached)
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
•	Left lower lobe transbronchial needle aspiration, transbronchial forceps biopsies
•	Left mainstem and left lower lobe biopsies
•	Left lower lobe bronchoalveolar lavage

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_018 SOURCE_FILE: note_018.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 60 year old-year-old female who presents with airway stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31631 Dilate and tracheal stent placement   
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision 
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Flexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Significant narrowing at the cord level, therapeutic scope was not able to be passed. 
 
Surgical Planning Measurements:
 	 
Distance from vocal folds to stenosis	 0 mm
Location of stenosis relative to cricoid 	At cricoid
Distance from top of stenosis to bottom 	105 mm
Distance of bottom of stenosis to carina	90 mm
Approximation of most narrow portion	6 mm
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Subglottic was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	Knife (needle)	Endo cut I 2 2 1	4secs burst	Radial cut
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 50% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 50% patent. 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Proximal 1/3).  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the Trachea (Proximal 1/3).  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Endobronchial excision of tissue was performed at Trachea (Proximal 1/3).  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.  Sheet of tissue completed peeled off with forceps in a circular fashion.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus and blood. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID:  note_252 SOURCE_FILE: note_252.txt Procedure Name: Bronchoscopy with endobronchial glue instillation 
Indications: Post-pneumonectomy broncho-pleural fistula
Medications: Per anesthesia
Patient intubated by anesthesia with 8.5 ETT prior to case. The Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through ETT and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. ETT tip was approximately 4cm above carina. The distal trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level and bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal without endobronchial lesions or secretions. The left mainstem stump was then visualized with obvious pinpoint BP fistula, the remained of the stump appeared to be intact however we did not probe the stump due to concern for extending the fistula. At this point the Veno-seal sealant delivery system catheter was advanced through the working channel of the bronchoscope and glue was then carefully applied to seal the fistula which appeared to be successful. The bronchoscope was then removed and our portion of the procedure was completed. 
Complications: none
Estimated Blood Loss: None
Post-procedure diagnosis: BF fistula with successful occlusion via sealant.

1.	Resolved bronchus-intermedius obstruction 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	 Recurrent resolved Bronchus-intermedius obstruction secondary to broncholith 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
lexible bronchoscopy with removal of broncholith 
1.	INDICATIONS:  Bronchus-intermedius obstruction secondary to broncholith
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. There was normal vocal cord motion and no vocal cord lesions. Additional topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the larynx and subsequently throughout the tracheobronchial tree with total volume via the anesthesia record. The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. The trachea was normal appearing with minimal clear thin secretions. These were suctioned clear. The bronchoscope was then advanced to the main carina, which was sharp. The bronchoscope was then advanced into the advanced into the left main stem there were copious thin secretions which were suctioned clear. Each segment and subsegement in the left upper lobe, lingula and lower lobe was visualized. The left sided airway anatomy was normal and no specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the left.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn into the trachea and then advanced into the right mainstem. The right mainstem and upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was a 30% obstructing area with post treatment changes from previous APC along with a new small broncholith protruding into the airway was well as changes consistent with underlying submucosal broncholith causing mild extrinsic compression. Gentle pressure was applied to remove the necrotic post-treatment debris within the airway. The lesion was then probed with the flexible bronchoscopy allowing the broncholith to be extracted from the airway wall and then removed with flexible forceps. There wasmild bleeding which resolved with topical epinephrine. This resulted in about 80% opening of the bronchus intermedius. At this point due to the lack of secured airway and risk of bleeding with more invasive removal we decided to not further explore the area. The bronchoscope was then passed beyond the BI to inspect the right middle, right lower lobe which were normal and no specific masses or other lesions were identified  Once we were satisfied that there was no residual bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure complete. 
Complications: None
Estimated blood loss: 5cc
Specimens: none
Recommendations:
- Repeat non-con CT
- Based on CT will likely return to OR next week for more aggressive removal of residual broncholith. 
- Will discharge home once criteria met.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_206 SOURCE_FILE: note_206.txt Procedure Name: EBUS Staging Bronchoscopy. (CPT 31653 convex probe endobronchial ultrasound sampling 3 or more hilar or mediastinal stations or structures).
Indications: diagnosis and staging of suspected lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.  The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. In the right lower lobe there was extrinsic compression seen most prominently in the superior segment. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were otherwise normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4L and 7 lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4L Lymph node, using an Olympus Visioshot2 EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE did not show evidence of malignancy. We then used the EBUS scope to visualize the 3cm mass adjacent to the right lower lobe and were able to access it with the EBUS TBNA needle. Preliminary ROSE was consistent with malignancy. Finally the EBUS bronchoscope was removed and utilizing the BF-XP190 ultrathin bronchoscope we were able to access the anterior segment if the right lower lobe and biopsy the distal endobronchial tumor with mini-forceps.  The ultrathin bronchoscope was removed and the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: None
Estimated Blood Loss: 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

INSTRUMENT : 
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level.
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	 	300	12	100	10	15
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2).  Target lesion is about 0.8 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 10 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
Fiducial marker was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
No evidence of a malignant neoplasm

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
No immediate complications
Based upon the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the ultrasound appearance and size, biopsies were not taken.
Site 2: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the ultrasound appearance and size, biopsies were not taken.
Site 3: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the ultrasound appearance and size, biopsies were not taken.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The bronchoscope was introduced into the mouth and advanced to the level of the vocal cords. A total of 6 mL of lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords. The bronchoscope was advanced to through the vocal cords into the trachea. The airways were examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. 
 
The RML was fishmouthed. The mucosa appeared normal.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LB1/2 and LB3, RB1 and 2 from mucus plug. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2).  Instilled 80 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  The bronchoscope was removed

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure (22 Modifier):
This patient required multiple forms of bronchoscopy (flexible and rigid).  The patient required both mechanical excision and APC ablation of granulation tissue.  Patient required stent placement and dilation in the left mainstem bronchus, but also required multiple balloon dilations at other discrete locations (left upper lobe, and left lower lobe) and on the opposite side (right mainstem bronchus). This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 
31630 Balloon dilation
31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision . 
 
Unusual Procedure (50 Modifier):
31630 Balloon dilation
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Bronchoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Normal.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Normal.
Main Carina: Somewhat splayed
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Stenosis noted about the anastamosis site/suture line. Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Proximal stenosis noted at the LMSB.  Metallic stent in the LMSB had migrated distally somewhat, leaving a stenotic and highly malacic ~1cm section of the LMSB proximal to the stent.  Lobar airways and distal had normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Granulation tissue at main carina, LMSB, and RMSB.  Otherwise normal.
Secretions: Thick tenacious mucus within the LMSB stent. Othwerwise, moderate, thin, and clear throughout.  
 
LMSB STENOSIS:  Overlying granulation tissue and proximal end of LMSB also highly malacic.

VIEW THROUGH STENT AT OUTSET OF PROCEDURE
 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.  
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at the left mainstem bronchus.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology. 
 
Granulation tissue causing stenosis at the proximal LMSB was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Mechanical	Pulmonary forceps	N/A	N/A	Good granulation tissue destruction/removal
APC	Straightfire probe	Forced coag, Effect 2	1-2 second applications	Good granulation tissue destruction and hemostasis
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
After induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black ventilating bronchoscope rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the distal-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. 
 
Foreign body removal was performed:  The patient's existing MicroTech 10mm x 40mm stent was grasped with the pulmonary forcpes and removed en bloc with the flexible bronchoscope through the rigid barrel.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
The following stent (Bonastent, 10mm x 50mm) was placed in the Left Mainstem bronchus. 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem through the stent to expand and appropriately seat the stent.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 4 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at the left lower lobe take-off.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the left lower lobe take-off.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
Balloon dilation was performed at the left upper lobe take-off.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the left upper lobe take-off.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Right Mainstem.  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the Right Mainstem.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
VIEW OF STENT AT THE END OF THE CASE
 
 
 
 
 
The rigid bronchoscope was extubated and an LMA replaced by the anesthesia team.  Lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--LLL BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
--LMSB endobronchial forceps biopsies (path)
--Left mainstem stent (path)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 68 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway stenosis. Patient was noted to have distal migration of his existing stent with proximal LMSB stenosis. The patient's stent was removed, balloon dilation was performed, and a Bonastent 10mm x 50mm stent was re-placed in the LMSB. The right mainstem bronchus was also dilated. Patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--Follow-up BAL and path results
--Continue stent hydration therapy regimen
--Repeat bronchoscopy in approximately 4 weeks for re-evaluation

NOTE: note_128
================================================================================

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_128 SOURCE_FILE: note_128.txt Patient name:  [REDACTED]

Preoperative diagnosis: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; Cough; Esophageal cancer; Malignant esophageal tumor; Pneumonia
Postoperative diagnosis: Same as above with addition of significant carcinomatosis and lymphangitic/metastatic spread of patient's malignancy causing severe and near complete obstruction primarily affecting the right lung.

Procedures performed:
31622 – Bronchoscopy, flexible, with or without fluoroscopic guidance, diagnostic
Balloon Dilation, 31630, Bronchoscopy rigid or flexible including fluoroscopic guidance when performed; with tracheal/bronchial dilation

Indications for the procedure: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; Cough; Esophageal cancer; Malignant esophageal tumor; Pneumonia

Anesthesia: General anesthesia using a #8.5endotracheal tube.

Procedure: After obtaining informed consent from the patient, the patient was brought to the procedure room. A proper timeout was performed to identify the correct patient and procedure to be performed. General anesthesia was administered.

Rigid bronchoscopy was performed with an 11mm ventilating scope. The patient, however, desaturated quickly despite relatively high driving pressures on jet ventilation (to the 60s), requiring extubation. The patient was bagged to bring saturations up and we intubated with the rigid scope again, but had the same thing happen. We then intubated with an 8.5 ETT and proceeded.

The T190/P190 video bronchoscope was introduced and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. There was significant adenopathy surrounding the vocal cords; however, patent vocal cords were noted on exam with mild erythema of the trachea following advancement. Left lung without any apparent superficial abnormality, other than secretions noted in the bilateral airway. Right lung with significant swelling, edema, erythema, and nodularity noted throughout, most prominently in the right middle and right lower lobe with significant secretions aspirated and near complete obstruction and narrowing of the airways.

We dilated the lower airway with an 8-9-10mm Elation balloon to better bypass the proximal tumor before assessing the distal disease. The dilation was temporary only, and collapse recurred.

Unfortunately, as we advanced past the proximal tumor obstruction with the P190 flexible bronchoscope, we could see tumor infiltration extending into all of the distal subsegments, making no appropriate landing point for stenting. We decided to terminate the procedure as the airway was not salvageable.

He was then taken to the ICU intubated.
Specimens: None

EBL: minimal

Bronchoscopes: Diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscope as well as rigid bronchoscope

NOTE_ID:  note_234 SOURCE_FILE: note_234.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:

1.       Tracheal stenosis

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:

1.       Tracheal stenosis

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:

1.       Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with Tracheal stent revision

INDICATIONS:  Stent evaluation and pre-surgical stenosis measurements

Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent.

Sedation: General Anesthesia

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in OR 23. Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position. 
At this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue. We were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time. The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure competed. 

. Approximately 4 cm below the vocal cords the previously placed silicone tube stent was visualized. There was mild granulation tissue at the proximal end which was non-obstructive. The stent was widely patent and clear of debris. . At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen. An LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space. The exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated. The mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent. The A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.  The excised 15x50mm silicone stent was cleaned and loaded into the Efer-dumon stent loading system and deployed through the rigid bronchoscope into the previous location without difficulty. The stent was well seated with the proximal limb approximately XXX cm distal to the vocal cords and the airway was 100% patent. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed, and the procedure completed.

Recommendations:

- Transfer PACU

- D/C home when criteria met

- Will discuss surgical planning with otolaryngology.
