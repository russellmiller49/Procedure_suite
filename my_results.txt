NOTE_ID:  note_084 SOURCE_FILE: note_084.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 74 year old-year-old female who presents with ILD.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Interstitial Lung Disease
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Interstitial Lung Disease
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31628 TBBX single lobe     
31654 Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion
D/C 31899NFK BRONCHOSCOPY, RIGID OR FLEXIBLE, INCLUDING FLUOROSCOPIC GUIDANCE AND OCCLUSION BALLOON, WHEN PERFORMED; WITH BRONCHIAL, ENDOBRONCHIAL, OR TRANSBRONCHIAL CRYOBIOPSY(S), SINGLE LOBE
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Transbronchial Cryo biopsies. This resulted in >60% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, Severity of patient's condition, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31628 TBBX single lobe     Pt with significant bleeding after biopsy that required blocker placement and attempt to clot blood. She continued to bleed and required admission to the ICU. Total time with blocker inflation was 24 minutes.
 ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Radial EBUS
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   50 cc but continued bleeding
COMPLICATIONS:    Bleeding requiring endobronchial blocker
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: .supine
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The patient was sedated by anesthesia. Next the bronchoscope was used to fiberoptically intubate the patient with a size 7 Ardnt blocker along side the ETT. The vocal cords are normal instructure and function. After atraumatic intubation the loop of the endobronchial blocker was moved to the RLL lateral subsegment
Evaluation of the airway was performed. There were no endobronchial lesions and the mucosa was normal. 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm there were no enlarged blood vessels in the segment of the RLL lateral segment.
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps at Lateral-basal Segment of RLL (RB9).  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology. There was no bleeding after this biopsy
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with 1.7 mm cryoprobe with a 4 second freeze. The scope and the cryoprobe were removed together at Lateral-basal Segment of RLL (RB9).  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology. Immediately after removal of the bronchoscope the balloon on the blocker was inflated with 3 cc. 
The balloon was left inflated for a total of 2 minutes. At the time of deflation there was continued bleeding. 
A total of 1000 mg of TXA, 2 mg epi, 5 cc iced saline were given through the end of the inflated blocker.
Additional isolation time of 5 minutes, followed by additional 10 minutes followed by another 10 minutes.
The ETT is at 21 cm at the front teeth and the blocker is at 29 cm at the front teeth.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was transferred to the ICU for continued care.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_164 SOURCE_FILE: note_164.txt Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy of unclear etiology
Procedure Performed: CPT 31653 EBUS bronchoscopy single station.
Pre-operative diagnosis: Mediastinal adenopathy 
Post-operative diagnosis: Mediastinal  adenopathy 
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The distal right trachea was partially externally compressed and the right mainstem at the orifice was significantly externally compressed (85%) which opened up to normal in the distal right mainstem. The left mainstem and takeoff were normal. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and moderate thick secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically suspicious station paratracheal mediastinal mass (level of 4R lymph node). The mass measured in short axis at 4.8 cm. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 19 gauge Visioshot-2 needle with a total of 6 needle passes. Rapid onsite evaluation read as suspicious for lymphoma. All samples were sent for routine cytology or flow cytometry. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 3 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_240 SOURCE_FILE: note_240.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  Marcelo Gadea is a 53 year old-year-old male who presents with proximal tracheal stent migration after placement 1 week ago for complete subglottic stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31630 Balloon dilation
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     
 
General Anesthesia
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~8ml via flexible bronchoscope
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was placed and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA. The vocal cords were edematous but open.  The patients known tracheal 12X20 Bonostent was visualized with the proximal edge abutting the distal aspect of the true vocal folds.  There was significant thick dry mucous with mild obstruction however the stent was otherwise patent. Just distal to the stent was a 4cm long complex tracheal stenosis with circumferential friable and edematous mucosa. An “A-shaped” deformity was visualized within the segment consistent with tracheal cartilage injury along with overlying granulation tissue creating a slit light obstruction of approximately 80% of the normal tracheal lumen. The mid to distal trachea was normal and full inspection of the distal tracheobronchial tree revealed no other abnormalities and all bronchial segments were widely patent to at least the 1st sub-segmental branch. The laryngeal mask airway was removed and a a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the supra-glottic space. Rigid alligator forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed without difficulty.  The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced through the vocal cords into the subglottic space and attached the jet ventilator.  Balloon dilatation of the stenotic segment was performed with a phased 8-9-10 Merit dilatational balloon.  Due to the deformity and lack of cartilaginous structure this only provided mild additional benefit.  The 10 mm rigid bronchosocpe was then telescoped into the tracheoscope and approximated to the level of the most significant stenosis.  The beveled tip was used to gently debulk granulation tissue with an apple coring technique. At this point a 12 X 40 bonostent was placed under direct visualization with the proximal edge at the level of the cricoid cartilage about 2 cm distal to the true vocal folds and the distal edge 1 cm beyond the distal stenotic segment.  Balloon dilatation of stent was performed using a phased 12-13.5-15 Merit dilatational balloon.  Following dilatation the trachea was widely patent with a luminal diameter approximately 95% of the normal. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed and the LMA re-inserted. Final inspection of the airway was performed and images captures after which the patient was turned over to anesthesia for recovery. 

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
 
IMPRESSION: Marcelo Gadea is a 53 year old-year-old male with complex tracheal stenosis s/p tracheal stent revision.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-	Transfer to PACU 
-	Discharge patient once criteria is met
-	Recommend continuing hypertonic saline for stent hydration
-           Follow-up in 2 weeks.

NOTE_ID:  note_183 SOURCE_FILE: note_183.txt PRE-PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: LEFT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
POST- PROCEDURE DIAGNISOS: LEFT UPPER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  
Flexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation under flouroscopic and EBUS guidance with transbronchial needle aspiration, Transbronchial biopsy and bronchioalveolar lavage.  
CPT 31654 Bronchoscope with Endobronchial Ultrasound guidance for peripheral lesion
CPT 31628 Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with transbronchial lung biopsy(s), single lobe
CPT +31624 Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with bronchial alveolar lavage
CPT +31627 Bronchoscopy with computer assisted image guided navigation
INDICATIONS FOR EXAMINATION:   Left upper lobe lung nodule            
MEDICATIONS:    GA
FINDINGS: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscope and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within apico-posterior branch of left upper lobe. Radial probe was used to attempt to confirm presence within the lesion. Although we were able to navigate directly to the lesion with navigation the radial probe view was suboptimal. Biopsy was performed initially with triple needle brush and TBNA needle. ROSE did not reveal evidence to support that we were within the lesion. Multiple attempts were made to manipulate the catheter and biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, and forceps, brush under fluoroscopic visualization. The specimens reviewed on-site remained suboptimal.  Multiple forceps biopsies were performed within the location of the lesion and placed in cell-block. After which a mini-BAL was then performed through the super-D catheter. We then removed the therapeutic bronchoscope with super-D catheter and reinserted the diagnostic scope at which point repeat airway inspection was then performed and once we were satisfied that no bleeding occurred, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None 
COMPLICATIONS:                 None

IMPRESSION:  
- S/P bronchoscopy with biopsy and lavage.
- Suboptimal navigational localization 
RECOMMENDATIONS
- Transfer to post-procedural unit
- Post-procedure CXR
- D/C home once criteria met
- Await pathology

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_196 SOURCE_FILE: note_196.txt Indications: Hodgkin’s Lymphoma with possible recurrence
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure: EBUS guided bronchoscopy 
CPT Codes: 31653 bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided transtracheal and/or transbronchial sampling 3 or more structures.
Procedural Details: 
The patient provided informed consent for the procedure after receiving an explanation in lay terms about the indications, details of the procedure, potential risks, and alternatives. All questions were addressed, and informed consent was documented in accordance with institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were conducted, and the findings were updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed before the intervention.
The patient received intravenous medications, as documented in the record, and topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree. The Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via a laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was properly positioned. The vocal cords appeared normal, and the subglottic space was unremarkable. The trachea had a normal caliber, and the carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. The bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal, with no endobronchial lesions or secretions observed.
The Q190 video bronchoscope was removed, and the UC180F convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via the laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree.
A directed EBUS examination was performed to evaluate the abnormal lymph node that had been previously identified and biopsied as follows
1.	After identification of the 11Rs lymph node transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed using the 19-gauge and 21 gauge Olympus ViziShot 2 EBUS-TBNA needles . A total of eight biopsies were performed. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) yielded lymphocytes.
2.	After identification of the station 7 lymph node transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed using the 19-gauge and 21 gauge Olympus ViziShot 2 EBUS-TBNA needles . A total of eight biopsies were performed. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) yielded lymphocytes.
3.	After identification of the station 4R lymph node transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was performed using the 19-gauge Olympus ViziShot 2 EBUS-TBNA needle and ROSE yielded scant tissue from a single pass, and it was decided to return our focus to a more abnormal appearing node given known Hodgkin’s and higher yield with larger tissue samples. 
4.	We then returned to the station 7 lymph node and created a tract with the 19-gauge Olympus ViziShot 2 EBUS-TBNA needle using the sheath to dilate the tract, the spybite mini-forceps were inserted through the tract and into the lymph node under EBUS guidance and tissue biopsies were obtained. A total of four tissue samples were obtained.  
Following the completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was re-inserted. After suctioning blood and secretions, no evidence of active bleeding was observed. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

 All TBNA samples were sent for routine cytology and mini-forceps sample were sent for histology. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided needle and forceps biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results
