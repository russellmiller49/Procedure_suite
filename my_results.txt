IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Transbronchial Cryo biopsies. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Technical difficulty of procedure and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31628 TBBX single lobe     . 
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:

Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	12	350	12	100	10	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical Segment of RUL (RB1).  
 
Balloon dilation was performed at RB1 subsegment to get through the distal carina.  4mm mustang balloon was used to perform dilation to 4 mm at the RB1 subsegment.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 8 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology and Pathology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm on Frozen Section (confirmed with Dr. Grace Lin). 
 
At this time, small (avuecue) microwave catheter was used to perform ablation. Location was confirmed with CBCT. 
 
Tset of 90oC, RP of 3, Tmax reached of 75oC, Total 12.2KJ delivered over 10mins.
 
Post abation 10mins CBCT was done to assess interval changes. 
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 10 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and no lymph nodes met the biopsy criteria.  
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
10R lymph node
10L lymph node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID: note_344	SOURCE_FILE: note_344.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis of left mainstem bronchus after transplant.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
 
General Anesthesia

ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:    <5mL
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted into the LMA and advanced to the carina. Bilateral airway inspection showed anastomosis on right was intact. No significant obstruction by granulation tissue. There was normal anatomic branching on right. Similarly left anastomosis was seen.  Stent was 60% obstructed with mucous. Once this was cleared the left mainstem was able traversed and inspected and there was normal anatomic branching. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at  Left mainstem .  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the  Left mainstem  from mucus plug. Sample sent for cell count and culture.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 
L mainstem BAL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for stent inspection. Stent place 1/5.  On 1/19 had been plugged by mucous, added guaifenisin and flutter valve to his regimen. He was planned for another bronch in 2-3 weeks, original plan of 4-6 weeks is too long based on how this stent appeared during last bronch. 
 
[ ] follow up cultures from mucous. 
[ ] repeat bronch in 2-3 weeks for stent evaluation

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. Airway exam notable for copious thick and thin clear mucus/secretions bilaterally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	400	12	100	8	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Blizzard Sign (GGO).
 
Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Needle was retracted and then advanced into the newly segmented lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Images showed tool-in-lesion. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 

 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 9 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 5 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. 
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage (mini-BAL) was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2) and Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Inflammatory cells; No evidence of a malignant neoplasm
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 21-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 

 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 5 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 

 
Site 3: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 

 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- LUL nodule TBNA (cyto and micro), transbronchial forceps bx (path), TBCBx (path, micro), brushing (cyto)

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The tracheostomy tube (Shiley 7.5ID cuffed) is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for large clot burden obstructing the entire LMSB. Moderate bloody secretions spilled over in the right airways. Once the secretions on the right had been cleared, the large RUL cavity with aspergilloma could be visualized from RB2 and RB3. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
The LMSB clot could not easily be removed with suctioning. Trach was too small to accommodate the bronchial blocker that was in place and the therapeutic bronchoscope. The bronchial blocker that was in the tracheostomy was removed.
 
Patient was fiberoptically intubated through the mouth with a 5.0ETT with Arndt bronchial blocker coupled on the outside. The blocker was parked in the proximal LMSB and the ETT was RMSB intubated to protect the right sided airways. Therapeutic scope was then introduced through the trach for rest of bronchoscopy. 
 
Combination of hydrodissection, high suction on the neptune were used to assist with removal of foreign body (clot) in LMSB. This also required cryoextraction due to organized nature and extent of clot burden. This required meticulous removal of clot for about 100 minutes .
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7mm probe	 	2-6sec	Cryoextraction
 
Prior to treatment, LMSB and LLL was note to be 0% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
 
There was moderate clot in the LUL which was left untouched. No active bleeding. Some purulent secretions were removed from LLL once clot burden was removed.
 
Measurements were taken and a 12x30mm Microtech stent was placed in the LLL/LMSB. Distal end of the stent is in the LLL truncus basalis (jailing off LB6 and LUL). Proximal end of stent is in the mid LMSB (~20mm from MC). 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The endotracheal tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 5 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 

 
Site 2: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 5 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 

 
Site 3: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 

 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 17 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- RML BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
- Station 11L, 4L, 4R TBNA (cyto, flow cytometry)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 52 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of lymphadenopathy. Patient underwent endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspirations on the 11L, 4L, and 4R lymph node stations. Samples were sent for cytology and flow cytometry. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--Post procedure CXR
--Follow up TBNA and BAL results
--Continued care per primary team

NOTE_ID: note_341	SOURCE_FILE: note_341.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 62 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required spray cryotherapy for treatment of bronchial stenosis. This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). The patient has a complex stenosis distal to the LMSB anastomosis that increased the technical difficulty of cryospray due to narrow airway. The stenosis is dynamic collapse and fixed stenosis. When performing the cryospray under apnea the airway lumen would collapse making the targeting of the spray more challenging.
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Bronchoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
After induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them.The patient was intubated atraumatically. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. 
 
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through rigid bronchoscope
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through rigid bronchoscope
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through rigid bronchoscope
Trachea: Mildly tortuous
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Lung transplant anastomosis suture site noted, no stenosis. Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology. 
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Stenosis at the distal LMSB. Distal airways with normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
 
Stenosis at Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Cryoprobe	Spray cryotherapy	Low flow	10-second applications x 3 treatments	Excellent application of spray cryotherapy
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 30% patent (5-6 mm).  After treatment, the airway was 50% patent 7-8 mm. 
 
Balloon dilation was then performed at the Left Mainstem stenosis.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was then performed at Left Mainstem stenosis.  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
The following stent (Bonastent 10mm x 30mm, covered) was placed in the Left Mainstem. 
 
Balloon dilation was then performed at Left Mainstem through the newly placed stent.  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the distal and proximal Left Mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
VIEW OF LMSB AFTER SPRAY CRYOTHERAPY AND STENT PLACEMENT
 

 

 

 

 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--LUL BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 62 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of bronchial stenosis. Patient underwent spray cryotherapy, balloon dilation, and bronchial stent placement without immediate complication.
 
--Post-procedure CXR
--Follow-up BAL results

NOTE_ID: note_307	SOURCE_FILE: note_307.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with lung mass.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31652 EBUS sampling 1 or 2 nodes
76982 Ultrasound Elastography, First Target Lesion
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
XS Separate Structure, a service that is distinct because it was performed on a separate organ/structure
32552 Removal of indwelling tunneled pleural catheter with cuff

 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle, 22-gauge Needle, and 19-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 11L lymph node
 
Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Positive for malignancy
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 8 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.
 
Endobronchial obstruction at LB1/2 LB3/4 was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	1.5 mm	Pulse apc 2	15s	ablated
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 75% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent.

NOTE_ID: note_345	SOURCE_FILE: note_345.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
An iGel was introduced by anesthesia. Next the bronchoscope was introduced into the iGel and advanced to the level of the vocal cords. The vocal cords are normal. A total of 6 mL of 1% lidocaine was instilled onto the vocal cords. The bronchoscope was advanced through the vocal cords into the trachea. The airways were examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
The Right anastomosis is intact with minimal narrowing along the 1 oclock position. The clip is still present without granulation tissue
 
The left anastomosis is scarred to approximately 11-12 mm and the bronchoscope easily advanced distal to this. There is a short segment of stenosis just proximal to the left hilum. The therapeutic bronchoscope could not easily traverse this stenosis. The diameter was ~ 5-6 mm. 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 4 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 

Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7	30 second rapid freeze thaw cycles	Total of 6 applications were performed	Improvement in airway diameter and able to accommodate the scope 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 50% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 70% patent. 
There were no post obstructive mucus. The LUL anterior subsegmental airway was narrowed due to collapse of the supportive structure
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL LUL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for worsening dyspnea after stent removed. Pt with improvement after starting pulmonary toilet regimen. 
- plan for follow up in clinic in 2-3 weeks
Continue pulmonary toilet

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. The vocal cords were normal appearing. Lidocaine was applied to the airway.
 
The right anastomosis site was intact and normal appearing. 
 
The left anastomosis site had narrowing and the scope was unable to pass it. Saline was used to irrigate the left lung and clear secretions. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Vocal Cord, Subglottic, Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left mainstem.  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm to 9 mm 10 mm at the left mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left mainstem.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm to 11 mm to 12 mm at the left mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.

Prior to treatment and dilation, affected airway was note to be 50% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. 
 
 
The following stent (microtech 12x30 mm) was placed in the left mainstem. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Left lower lobe BAL

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID: note_343	SOURCE_FILE: note_343.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis of left mainstem bronchus after transplant.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31635 Foreign body removal
 
General Anesthesia

 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   <5mL
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted into the LMA and advanced to the carina. Bilateral airway inspection showed anastomosis on right was intact. No significant obstruction by granulation tissue. There was normal anatomic branching on right. Similarly left anastomosis was seen.  Stent was 90% obstructed with tenacious and thick mucous. Once this was cleared the left mainstem was able traversed and inspected and there was normal anatomic branching. The stent had migrated distally by a few millimeters, though still maintaining adequate patency. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Left mainstem.  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Left mainstem from mucus plug. The foreign body was able to be aspirated after lavage and scrubbing. Sample sent for cell count and culture.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 
L mainstem BAL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for stent inspection. Stent place 1/5. Already very obstructed with mucous. There is question of possible distal migration as well. We added guaifenisin and flutter valve to his regimen. It isn't clear if he is doing his regimen or how frequently. We asked him to make sure he is doing it TID and in appropriate order to prevent this from getting clogged again. He needs another bronch in 2-3 weeks, original plan of 4-6 weeks is too long based on how this stent appeared. 
 
[ ] follow up cultures from mucous. 
[ ] repeat bronch in 2-3 weeks for stent evaluation and possible revision (anticoagulation should be held)

I confirm that I was present for all portions of the service, including a review of the patient's history and other pertinent data. I personally examined the patient, and formulated the evaluation and/or treatment plan. I was present for the entirety of the procedure.  I have reviewed the note of Taylor, Caleb James, MD, MPH  and agree with the findings documented in the note, with any exceptions as noted below.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. Thick mucus and plugs were noted throughout the airway. These were suctioned.
 
The left lower lobe superior segment came off in the left mainstem and the right upper lobe had early bifurcation. 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug.

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2).  Target lesion is about 1.5 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 8 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, mucus plug, and blood. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical Segment of RUL (RB1), Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2), and Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 2: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 1 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 3 elastographic pattern, predominantly stiff (blue), raising concern for malignancy. Based on this finding, the lymph node was prioritized for TBNA with multiple passes obtained to maximize diagnostic yield.
 
Site 3: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken
 
Site 4: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 5: The 11Ri lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Non-Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, mucus plug, blood, and blood clots. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 54 year old-year-old male who presents with abnormal chest imaging.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
 
XS Separate Structure, a service that is distinct because it was performed on a separate organ/structure
 
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Versed             5 mg
Fentanyl          175 mcg
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   1030
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   1119
 
Total moderate sedation time was 49 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by Matt Reed. 
 
The airway was inspected. The laryngopharynx was normal appearing, somewhat floppy. Lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the airway. There were thick mucus plugs throughout the airway. The right lower lobe anatomy was slightly deviated.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Subglottic, Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, mucus plug, and blood. 
 
Some suction trauma occurred. 

The mucus plugs were suctioned, saline was used to irrigate the airway and suctioned. Lidocaine was applied again.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

ATTENDING:  
[REDACTED]
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for mild amount of bloody secretions throughout the right sided airways with mild mucosal injury from scope trauma at the distal BI. The left airways show stent well seated in the mid LMSB with distal end still in LLL truncus basalis. Moderate bloody secretions in the LLL. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), and LLL from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8).  Instilled 80 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- LLL BAL 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure. Stent in good position, mild to moderate bloody secretions aspirated. BAL from LLL sent.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 29 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31899NFJ TRACHEOSTOMY CHANGE AFTER ESTABLISHMENT OF FISTULA TRACT; WITHOUT AN E/M SERVICE OR OTHER ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURE
31615 Visualization of windpipe (Tracheobronchoscopy through established tracheostomy incision)
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Versed             2 mg
Fentanyl          50 mcg
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   1205
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   1215
 
Total moderate sedation time was 10 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by Matt Reed. 
 
Lidocaine was applied via the tracheostomy tube.
 
The airway was inspected and the anatomy was normal bilaterally. Secretions were noted and suctioned.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
The cuff was deflated and the tracheostomy tube was easily removed.  The stoma appeared widely patent with minimal granulation tissue visualized.  The new tracheostomy tube was then placed with obturator in place.  The obturator was removed, inner cannula was placed and the cuff inflated.
 
Percutaneous tracheostomy was changed from:
Shiley cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 7.5 mm
 
To 
Shiley cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 7.5 mm
 
without issue.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 29 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure.

22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a pt with complex stenosis, post obstructive pneumonia with bleeding airways. The airways required multiple dilation to remove foreign body . This resulted in >50% increased work due to Increased intensity, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31630 Balloon dilation
31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus
31635 Foreign body removal. 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Bronchoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Flexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The patient was sedated and an iGel was placed by anesthesia. The bronchoscope was advanced to the level of the vocal cords. The vocal cords are normal in structure. A total of 6 mL of 1% lidocaine was instilled onto the vocal cords. The bronchoscope was advanced through the vocal cords into the trachea. 
 
The airways were examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. The Right anastomosis was intact without stenosis. The LMSB had stenosis just distal to the anastomosis. The stenosis was approximately 4 mm and the therapeutic and P190 bronchoscope could not be advanced through the stenosis. The stent was seen distal to the stenosis. Proximal to the stenosis the airway had some malacia
 
The iGel was removed and the patient was intubated atraumatically with a black ventilating rigid bronchoscope. 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each. After dilation the P-190 bronchoscope could be advanced through the stenosis. 
 
The stent was seen distal to the stenosis and the LUL was occluded by the stent. Using the bronchoscope the stent was lifted and a large amount of white-yellow pus was therapeutically aspirated. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Endobronchial tumor was noted and excised with mechanical debridement from the LMSB. 
 
The proximal end of the stent was now able to be visualized. Using rat tooth forceps the stent was grasped and removed enbloc through the rigid bronchoscope. No residual material was left in the airway
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 

Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.1	10 -30 second freeze thaw cycles	Total of 6 treatments	Improvement in airway diameter to 8mm
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 20% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 60% patent. 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each. After this dilation the therapeutic bronchoscope could be advanced through the stenosis.
 
The following stent (Bona stent 10 x 30) was placed in the Left Mainstem. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL - LUL
Foreign body removal - path
LMSB bronchus tissue/tumor path
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 60 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for worsening dyspnea on exertion, wheezing and difficulty with getting mucus out. Stent found have migrated distally with airway obstruction of the LUL and post obstructive pneumonia. 
Pt to be admitted for IV antibiotics 
Please resume stent hygiene with albuterol neb, followed by 3% saline nebulizer. This should be done TID. 
Add guaifenesin 1200 mg po BID
Please keep NPO after midnight until pulmonary team is able to see patient to assess if additional bronchoscopy is needed

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Entire airway normal (via ETT)
The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. Airway exam notable for mild mucus/secretions bilaterally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	12	300	12	10	100	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Blizzard Sign (GGO).
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
The robotic catheter was then advanced near the newly segmented lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Images showed tool-in-lesion. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 

 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 7 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage (mini-BAL) was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical Segment of RUL (RB1), Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2), and Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Inflammatory cells; No evidence of a malignant neoplasm
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- RUL nodule TBNA (cyto and micro), TBCBx (path and micro)
- RUL BAL 
- Station 4L TBNA 
 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:  [REDACTED]   is a 44 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of diffuse groundglass opacities. The patient underwent robot-assisted bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration without immediate complication.

General Anesthesia

 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   30mL
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted into the LMA and advanced through the vocal cords into the airway. Bilateral airway inspection showed complex stenosis and malacic area at anastomosis on left mainstem. Right anastomosis was normal with a clip visible in the airway lumen. The anatomic segmental branching was normal. There was granulation tissue partially obstruction left anastomosis from 10 o clock to 5 o clock position. 
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at Left Mainstem anastomosis.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	2.4mm	30 s freeze and thaw cycle 4 applications 10 o clock, 12 o clock 2o clock 4 o clock	 	Improved luminal patency
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60s seconds each.
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 60% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 80% patent. 
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8) and Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9).  Total 8 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 
LLL TBBx
LMSB EBBx
Lingula BAL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 69 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial stenosis and Tbbx to rule out rejection
 
[ ] cxr in pacu
[ ] Stenosis is complex and partially malacic with some granulation tissue. Will likely need a stent trial in short interval, follow up in clinic

NOTE_ID: note_355	SOURCE_FILE: note_355.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED]is a 85 year old male who presents with Pleural Effusion.  
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. The nature, indications, purpose, benefits, risks, potential complications, and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Thoracentesis were discussed with the patient or surrogate decision-maker in detail.  Patient or surrogate decision-maker agreed to proceed with procedure.  The patient or surrogate decision-maker read and signed the provided consent form or provided consent over the phone. If consent was provided over the phone, then the consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Pleural Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32555 Aspirate pleura with imaging (thoracentesis)
 
50 Bilateral Procedures (Procedure done on both sides of the body) and 59 Similar to 51 but for uncommonly combined procedures. Can be used if a diagnostic procedure is performed which provides information which leads to a therapeutic procedure (XE/XS/XP/XU)
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: Unusual Procedure (50 MODIFIER):
This patient required a bilateral procedure today when this procedure would typically be unilateral. Apply to:
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
 
59 MODIFIER:
This thoracentesis procedure was performed in addition to the bronchoscopy procedure.  These are separate and uncommonly combined procedures.  This thoracentesis was performed in the pre-operative area.  The patient was then taken to a different location (the operative area) and underwent bronchoscopy procedure  please see separate documentation for that procedure.
 
Local Anesthesia (Lidocaine)
 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
PROCEDURE(S) IN DETAIL:
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, MRN, DOB, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
PATIENT POSITION:  Sitting
 
LEFT CHEST ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE:
FINDINGS:
Hemithorax:  LEFT
Pleural Effusion: 
Volume:  Small
Echogenicity:  Anechoic
Loculations:  None
Diaphragmatic Motion:  Normal
Lung: 
Lung sliding before procedure:  Present
Lung sliding post procedure:  See other ultrasound exam below
Lung consolidation/atelectasis:  Present - very minimal at lung base consistent with atelectasis
Pleura:  Normal
Image(s) saved and uploaded:  YES - saved to Media tab
 
RIGHT CHEST ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE:
FINDINGS:
Hemithorax:  RIGHT
Pleural Effusion: 
Volume:  Tiny - not amenable to thoracentesis
Echogenicity:  Anechoic
Loculations:  None
Diaphragmatic Motion:  Normal
Lung: 
Lung sliding before procedure:  Present
Lung sliding post procedure:  N/A
Lung consolidation/atelectasis:  Present - tiny at lung base, consistent with atelectasis.
Pleura:  Normal
Image(s) saved and uploaded:  YES - saved to Media tab
 
LEFT THORACENTESIS PROCEDURE:
Anatomic landmarks and ultrasound-guidance were utilized to determine the appropriate insertion site.  Insertion site marked.  Thoracentesis Kit was used. 
 
ANESTHESIA:   Lidocaine 1%: 10 mL      Other:  
 
Entry Site: LEFT 7th Intercostal Space in the Mid-scapular line
 
Procedure was performed using sterile technique throughout.  Insertion site prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine was used to anesthesize the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superior aspect of the inferior rib periosteum and parietal pleura. A #10 scalpel blade was used to nick the skin at the insertion site.  A Cook 5Fr Yueh over-the-needle catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. The needle and over-the-needle catheter were introduced through the skin incision into the pleural space while applying negative aspiration pressure.  Entry into pleural space was confirmed by aspiration of light yellow-colored fluid.  While holding the insertion needle stable, the catheter was then threaded into the pleural space without difficulty.  The insertion needle was removed.  Pleural fluid was aspirated through the catheter via manual aspiration without difficulty - see fluid description and aspirated volume below.  The catheter was then removed while patient exhaled.  Pressure briefly held until minimal bleeding stopped and bandage applied over site.
 
Fluid Description:  Light yellow Serous
Fluid Volume Removed: 250 ml 
 
Drainage method:   Manual aspiration into drainage bag.
Pleural pressures:   Not measured.
 
Reason pleural fluid aspiration was stopped:  Unable to manually aspirate any further fluid.
 
Post-procedure Chest Ultrasound (after thoracentesis catheter removed) showed:

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID: note_312	SOURCE_FILE: note_312.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents with left anastomotic stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left anastomotic dehiscence 
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left anastomotic dehiscence 
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31630 Balloon dilation
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision 
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The patient was sedated and an iGel was placed by anesthesia. The bronchoscope was introduced into the iGel and advanced to the level of the vocal cords. A total of 4 mL of 2% lidocaine was instilled into the vocal cords. 
 
The bronchoscope was advanced through vocal cords into the trachea. There were several areas consistent with TPO. The right anastomosis has a staple herniating through at the 1 o'clock position. There was no evidence of dehiscence.  The left anastomosis was covered by a bona stent. The stent was in adequate position. The distal end of the stent had some granulation tissue and stenosis. 
The RUL anterior segment had narrowing due to collapse of cartilage.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 30 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Endobronchial obstruction at distal LMSB was treated with the following modalities:
 

Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	1.5	25W/2	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	2.4	 	10 seconds	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 90% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 95% patent. 
 
Endobronchial tumor was noted and excised with mechanical debridement with forceps and this was send for pathology. There was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was removed. 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at distal LMSB.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 11 mm at the distal LMSB.  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL LUL
Endobronchial tissue distal LMSB
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for tracheal stenosis s/p stenting on 1/5/2024.
Stent check/removal in 4 weeks

INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
 
DATE OF PROCEDURE: [REDACTED]
 
 
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents with hemoptysis and respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
 
ATTENDING:  
[REDACTED]
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Continued IV infusions with 2 mg dilaudid bolus
 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Bloody secretions and blood clot noted at right-sided airways, particularly RML and RB6 subsegment. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Stent well-seated at LMSB with distal end at LLL truncus basalis. Moderate bloody as well as clear secretions. LUL and LB6 jailed off by stent, otherwise normal anatomic branching to segmental level.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear with some blood.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
Blood secretions in the RML
Thin, white-yellow mucus in the LLL antero-medial, lateral and posterior segments
Defect seen in stent at 2 o'clock position with bubbling from it
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airways and reassessment of stent position and hemoptysis. Tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--Plan for repeat bronchoscopy in OR later this week for endobronchial blocker placement (plan for Amplatzer vascular plug)
--Continue stent hydration
--Continued care per primary team
