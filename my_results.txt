NOTE_ID: note_349	SOURCE_FILE: note_349.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED]is a 35 year old-year-old female who presents with Recurrent Effusion.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Tunnel Pleural Catheter Placement were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Complicated Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
75989 Radiological guidance (use with IPC placement)
32550 Insertion of indwelling tunneled pleural catheter with cuff
 
 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Versed             4 mg
Fentanyl          125 mcg
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   0933
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   1010
 
Total moderate sedation time was 37 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by Rebecca Cleary. 
 
RN: Rebecca Cleary and Andrew Karn
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.

Procedure Findings

A finder needle was used to enter the pleural space in the right 3 4th intercostal space along the mid-axillary line. Bloody pleural fluid was aspirated. The needle was withdrawn and a guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the catheter. Two 5-mm skin incisions were made at the guidewire entry site, as well as approximately 5 6 cm away (anteriorly and inferiorly). The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter through the subcutaneous tissue. Serial dilation over the guidewire was performed, and an introducer sheath was placed. The guidewire was removed, and the catheter was advanced into the pleural space via the introducer sheath. The pleural entry site was closed with absorbable suture. The catheter was secured to the skin using 2-0 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied.

Tunnel length: 5.5 cm

Exit site: Other   mid-clavicular

Fluid Removed: 800 mL, stopped due to coughing

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. The vocal cords were normal appearing. 
 
The airway anatomy was scarred and somewhat distorted, but similar to previous appearances.
 
The right middle lobe was narrowed, it was not able to be traversed with the therapeutic bronchoscope or the single use slim scope.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
The right middle lobe was not dilated, but we will monitor it.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
right middle lobe bronchoalveolar lavage
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway inspection and evaluation.
 
-Plan for follow up bronchoscopy in ~4 weeks
-Follow up bronchoscopic lab work

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. Airway exam notable for mild mucus/secretions bilaterally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.

RIGHT LOWER LOBE TARGET
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Segment of RLL (RB6).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Heterogeneous echogenicity.
 
Needle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Needle was retracted and then advanced into the newly segmented lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Images showed tool-in-lesion. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 8 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 5 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. 
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage (mini-BAL) was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of RLL (RB6).  Instilled 80 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 

 
Site 2: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 

 
Site 3: The 11Ri lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 5 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 

 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

Target 1: RML
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Lateral Segment of RML (RB4).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Target 2: LUL
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target.

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 21-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11L lymph node
 
Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Suggestive of benign-appearing lymphoid tissue
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Final results are pending.
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Suggestive of benign-appearing lymphoid tissue. Final results are pending.
 
Site 3: The 11Rs lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis. Final results are pending.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 60 year old-year-old male who presents with lung .  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
 
 
General Anesthesia

RT: Juliet Barnia
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
There were significant malacia noted in LMS about 2cm from the main carina.  After traversing through this, the stent was noted to be in good position.  Lightly covered by mucus. 
 
Bronchial washing was performed at Left Mainstem.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Washing
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 60 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for stent evaluation.
 
- completed - return for bronch evaluation in 6 weeks
- consider longer stent in discussion with lung transplant

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 65 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31648 Bronchial valve removal initial  lobe

 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. Lidocaine was applied. The trachea and right lung were normal appearing. The left upper lobe was stretched. The left lower lobe had valves in place with mucus noted. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
The left lower lobe was irrigated and washed with multiple rounds of saline. This was suctioned.
 
Alligator forceps were used to remove each of the valves, there were five valves identified and these were each removed. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 30 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, mucus plug, and blood. 
 
Some granulation tissue was noted at the left lower lobe superior segment. This was excised with alligator forceps.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Left lower lobe endobronchial valves, biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 65 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure.
 
-Follow up bronchoscopic lab work
-Plan for valve replacement in ~6 weeks

NOTE_ID:  note_277 SOURCE_FILE: note_277.txt 
 
 
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 73 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
PROCEDURE:  
31899 Unlisted Procedure (Trach Change with Mature Tract or Procedure NOS)
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31899NFJ TRACHEOSTOMY CHANGE AFTER ESTABLISHMENT OF FISTULA TRACT; WITHOUT AN E/M SERVICE OR OTHER ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURE
31615 Visualization of windpipe (Tracheobronchoscopy through established tracheostomy incision)
 
XS Separate Structure, a service that is distinct because it was performed on a separate organ/structure
Airway endoscopy performed separately from Gastroenterology endoscopy procedure
 

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
The cuff was deflated and the tracheostomy tube was easily removed.  The stoma appeared widely patent and no granulation tissue was immediately visualized.  The new tracheostomy tube was then placed with obturator in place.  The obturator was removed, inner cannula was placed and the cuff inflated.
 
Percutaneous tracheostomy was changed from:
Portex cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 7.0mm
 
To 
Portex cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 7.0mm
 
without issue.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 73 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for tracheostomy change.

IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure (22 MODIFIER):
This patient required multiple modalities for relief of stenosis - including dilation with the rigid tracheoscope barrel and balloon dilation.  The patient required cryospray, which necessitates increased personnel and resource support in the OR in order to safely perform and unusual clinical expertise. This resulted in >80% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 
31630 Balloon dilation
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Bronchoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Mild
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Normal.
Larynx: Normal.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: : On initial evaluation the patient was noted to have mucus collected at the subglottic space. There was a very small diverticula noted at the anterior mid-trachea - at approximately 12 o'clock location. Additionally, there were multiple areas of stenosis along the trachea with the narrowest region at the distal 1/3 such that the therapeutic scope was unable to be passed across the stenosis.  There was a slight ridge of tissue at the 7-8 o'clock location - this ridge was improved from previous.  Balloon dilation was performed (see below) which allowed the bronchoscope to traverse past the distal tracheal stenosis and assess the remaining airways 
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Friable
Secretions: Moderate thick and thin secretions/mucus
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, left lower lobe from mucus. 
 
MUCUS AT SUBGLOTTIC SPACE

 
DIVERTICULA AT ANTERIOR MID TRACHEA

 
STENOSIS AT DISTAL TRACHEA

 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 10 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Bronchial washing was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
After induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black rigid short non-ventilating tracheoscope barrel (12.00 - 11.00 mm) was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth. The patient was noted to have a very mobile epiglottis and tight oropharynx making intubation with the tracheoscope challenging but not insurmountable.  The vocal cords were identified and the rigid tracheoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them. Once the rigid tracheoscope was positioned at the proximal-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed.
 
Due to stenosis, further advanced of the rigid tracheoscope was challenging without causing mucosal trauma - which we wanted to avoid in hopes of treating with cryospray.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Proximal 1/3).  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
The rigid tracheoscope was then advanced further into the proximal trachea and into the distal trachea.  
Dilation was performed using the rigid tracheoscope of the proximal trachea and mid-trachea.  The rigid tracheoscope was used to perform dilation to 12 mm in the proximal trachea and rigid trachea.  This was a single dilation that was performed for 10+ minutes.  While dilating 
 
Cryospray was then performed at the distal tracheal stenosis causing endotracheal/endobronchial obstruction as follows:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Cryospray cryotherapy	STERIS CryoSpray catheter 	Low-flow	10-second applications x 6 cycles.  
Despite priming outside of the airway, application of cryospray was limited by repeat chest rise.  Only one of these cycles was a complete 10-second treatment.  Most cycles lasted 5-8 seconds. Therefore, additional cycles performed at the site to compensate for the shortened durations. 	Overall, good application of spray cryotherapy to the area of distal tracheal stenosis.
 
Patient also with prolonged episodes of hypoxia after each cryospray treatment, especially when treatments performed close together (when allowing only for the standard 1 minute between treatments).  This improved with increasing Jet ventilation driving pressure from 24 --> 28 --> 30.  Likely related to reduced air flow/ventilation past the area of distal stenosis.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3).  12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 13.5 mm and 15 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3).  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds and 60 seconds, respectively.
 
After dilation, there was a mild mucosal tear without perforation was noted at the left postero-lateral aspect of the distal trachea (7 o'clock to 8 o'clock region).  This area had mild oozing of blood - Nashville Grade II bleeding.  This was treated with a combination of cold saline and Epinephrine (total 0.4mg).
 
DISTAL TRACHEAL STENOSIS AT CONCLUSION OF PROCEDURE

 

 

 
Prior to treatment, the distal trachea airway was note to be 40% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 80% patent.  
 
Rigid bronchoscope was extubated.  LMA replaced by anesthesia team.  Flexible therapeutic bronchoscope advanced again - confirmed no injury to the vocal cords proxima or mid trachea from the rigid scope.
 
Residual secretions, saline, and minimal blood suctioned to clear.  No active bleeding.  Flexible bronchoscope was removed.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:

The airway was inspected via the LMA. The right anastamosis site was intact. There was a staple visible, it was minimally involved in the airway lumen, so it was left intact.
 
The left anastamosis was covered by the stent. The stent had migrated to mostly cover the left lower lobe orifice. 
 
The jumbo forceps were used gently peel the stent off the airway wall. Then it was slowly pulled back to ensure it was freely mobile. Then the forceps were used to remove the stent en bloc from the airway. The stent was sent for culture.
 
Next the left mainstem was inspected, the anastamosis site was intact. There was some granulation tissue which was bleeding. This was controlled with iced saline. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	2.4 mm	Therapeutic freeze	7-15 seconds	Ablation of the granulation tissue
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Left lower lobe BAL
Left mainstem stent
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 70 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stent inspection.
 
-Stent removed
-Follow up bronchoscopy in ~2-3 weeks to reinspect the site of previous stent
