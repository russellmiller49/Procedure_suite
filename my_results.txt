NOTE_ID:  note_128 SOURCE_FILE: note_128.txt Patient name:  [REDACTED]

Preoperative diagnosis: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; Cough; Esophageal cancer; Malignant esophageal tumor; Pneumonia
Postoperative diagnosis: Same as above with addition of significant carcinomatosis and lymphangitic/metastatic spread of patient's malignancy causing severe and near complete obstruction primarily affecting the right lung.

Procedures performed:
31622 – Bronchoscopy, flexible, with or without fluoroscopic guidance, diagnostic
Balloon Dilation, 31630, Bronchoscopy rigid or flexible including fluoroscopic guidance when performed; with tracheal/bronchial dilation

Indications for the procedure: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; Cough; Esophageal cancer; Malignant esophageal tumor; Pneumonia

Anesthesia: General anesthesia using a #8.5endotracheal tube.

Procedure: After obtaining informed consent from the patient, the patient was brought to the procedure room. A proper timeout was performed to identify the correct patient and procedure to be performed. General anesthesia was administered.

Rigid bronchoscopy was performed with an 11mm ventilating scope. The patient, however, desaturated quickly despite relatively high driving pressures on jet ventilation (to the 60s), requiring extubation. The patient was bagged to bring saturations up and we intubated with the rigid scope again, but had the same thing happen. We then intubated with an 8.5 ETT and proceeded.

The T190/P190 video bronchoscope was introduced and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. There was significant adenopathy surrounding the vocal cords; however, patent vocal cords were noted on exam with mild erythema of the trachea following advancement. Left lung without any apparent superficial abnormality, other than secretions noted in the bilateral airway. Right lung with significant swelling, edema, erythema, and nodularity noted throughout, most prominently in the right middle and right lower lobe with significant secretions aspirated and near complete obstruction and narrowing of the airways.

We dilated the lower airway with an 8-9-10mm Elation balloon to better bypass the proximal tumor before assessing the distal disease. The dilation was temporary only, and collapse recurred.

Unfortunately, as we advanced past the proximal tumor obstruction with the P190 flexible bronchoscope, we could see tumor infiltration extending into all of the distal subsegments, making no appropriate landing point for stenting. We decided to terminate the procedure as the airway was not salvageable.

He was then taken to the ICU intubated.
Specimens: None

EBL: minimal

Bronchoscopes: Diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscope as well as rigid bronchoscope

ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Versed             4 mg
Fentanyl          100 mcg
Etomidate20mg
Rocuronium43mg
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   1513
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   1700
 
Total moderate sedation time was 107 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by ICU RN. 
 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The endotracheal tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Copious thick and thin light-yellow mucus/secretions throughout.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
===========================================
 
NECK ULTRASOUND OF PROPOSED TRACHEOSTOMY INSERTION SITE
 
 
The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization.  The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized.  Next, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% 3ml ml was injected into the anterior neck.  A 1 cm incision was made horizontallywith a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.  The introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization.  Next, a J-wire was passed through the catheter, also visualized with the bronchoscope.  The site was then dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.  
 
The 14 Fr dilator was then removed from the guide wire and an 8 Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level.  The tissue dilator was placed over the guiding catheter until the positioning mark was visualized via the bronchoscope.  The tissue dilator was then removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
 
Finally a Portex 7.0mm cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization.  The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were then removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place.  This was confirmed to be in good position bronchoscopically.  The Endotracheal tube was then removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube.   Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding.  A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications. The staff physician was present throughout the entire procedure. 
 
===========================================
 
Under sterile prep and draping, the abdomen was evaluated and 2 cm below the costal margin on the left, the likely point of insertion was identified. Ultrasound was used and hepatic tissue was identified just under the standard/traditional PEG insertion site.
 
TRADITIONAL INSERTION SITE
 
 
As such, a new more lateral insertion site was chosen and no hepatic tissue was identified on ultrasound.
 
PROPOSED INSERTION SITE
 
 
The scope was introduced through the mouth without difficulty and with continuous insufflation, the stomach was reached within 10 seconds. Then, the point of digital pressure was identified in the stomach and transillumination was accomplished successfully and without any doubts. 
At this point, a 1cm incision was carried out in the skin and a 14ga angiocath was introduced. Using modified Seldinger technique, the angiocath was advanced and a wire was introduced. Using pull through technique, the guide wire was pulled through the mouth and linked to the 20Fr PEG catheter in usual fashion. Thereafter, the wire was pulled through the abdominal wall and the PEG tube positioned correctly with the bumper at 1.5 cm. The remaining air was suctioned out and complete apposition of the stomach and esophagus was seen. There were no complications. 
The total procedural time was 20 minutes.
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
PEG can be used for medications 6 hrs post procedure (@2200)
PEG (or NG tube) can be used for feeds 6 hrs post procedure (@2200). No enteral feeding prior.
OK to restart systemic anticoagulation @2200, if needed.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--RML BAL (cell count, cyto, micro)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 68 year old-year-old female who presents for tracheostomy and PEG tube placement.
 
--Post-procedure CXR
--Anticipate suture removal in 7 days (~12/29/2025)
--Anticipate trach change in 10 days (~1/1/2026)
--PEG can be used for medications and tube feeds at 2200 on 12/22/2025
--If required to place gauze underneath the skin bumper, please use only 1 thin layer and change as needed, as this can lead to tension on the gastric cuff and result in complication. 
--Please call the Interventional pulmonary fellow on call should there be any issues with the PEG.

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Transbronchial Cryo biopsies. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31628 TBBX single lobe
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level.
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	 	300	12	100	10	15
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is not well visualized.  The following features were noted: aerated lung.
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
No evidence of a malignant neoplasm
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of LLL (LB6), Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
No immediate complications
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was not photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
•	left lower lobe transbronchial needle aspiration, transbronchial cryobiopsy, transbronchial brushing, sub segmental bronchoalveolar lavage, lobar bronchoalveolar lavage
•	EBUS-TBNA 11L
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 48 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for lung nodule.

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure (22 MODIFIER):
This patient required the following at 3 different/discrete sites, although all 3 sites were within the same lobe they were in distinct/different locations within the lobe:  robotic navigational bronchoscopy to the different sites, brushings, radial EBUS, CT-guided needle placement, transbronchial needle aspiration, transbronchial cryo biopsies.  The patient required the following at 2 different/discrete sites:  bronchoalveolar lavage.  The patient required ultrasound elastrography evaluation of 7 different/discrete sites (6 lymph node sites and 1 adrenal mass site), with the images/interpretation used for intraprocedural decision-making; this also extended the time necessary for the EBUS procedure and extended the time necessary for the EUS-B procedure.
This resulted in >150% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to:

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled, or if otherwise concerning appearing.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 21-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 
4R (lower paratracheal) node - Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography mode was performed on this lymph node to assess its stiffness and tissue characteristics, and to identify different densities in this target lymph node. Semi-qualitivative analysis of this lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastograpic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.  The elastography interpretation was separate from the typical interpretation of linear EBUS ultrasound images.  Along with the lymph node size, the elastographic pattern information/interpretation was used to make the decision to not perform transbronchial sampling of this lymph node.  This image was store and archived.

This image was store and archived.  
Sampling:  The site was sampled.. 4 endoscopic ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained.   Sent for cytology.  
Evidence of small hematoma forming around the adrenal mass on EUS-B evaluation.  Therefore, no further tissue obtained.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and "Lesional". Final results are pending.
 
The EUS-B scope was withdrawn and the Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope readvanced into esophagus and stomach with the assistance of air insufflation for repeat assessment.  No evidence of mucosal or intraluminal bleeding.  Air was exsufflated while removing the scope.
 
Bronchoscope was removed.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimal
COMPLICATIONS:     None

NOTE_ID:  note_212 SOURCE_FILE: note_212.txt Procedure Name: Medical Thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with parietal pleural biopsies
CPT code(s): CPT 320098 Thoracotomy, with biopsy(ies) of pleura
Indications: Left sided pleural effusion
Medications: As per anesthesia record
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had multiple simple appearing adhesions and small whitish plaques were seen along the posterior parietal pleural. The 5mm disposable primary port was then replaced with an 8mm disposable primary port via the same tract and optical cupped biopsy forceps were introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. After gentle lysis of simple adhesions with the blunt closed forceps, biopsies of the suspicious areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with rigid cupped forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, a 14 French pigtail catheter was inserted through the port site and attached to pleuro-vac with suction. After air evacuation with cessation of bubbling in pleuro-vac the chest tube was removed and the site sutured and dressed. 
Complications: None
The patient tolerated the procedural well.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed full lung re-expansion with minimal residual pleural effusion. 
Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion 
Recommendation:
Discharge once post-op criteria met
Will await pathology and microbiological studies

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a significant airway management and endobronchial hair removal. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Increased intensity, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision . 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Airway noted to be stable with significant airway pressure.  Stent was noted to be migrated distally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Foreign body (stent) was noted in the distal trachea.  BonaStent (14x60) was removed with forceps. 
 
Significant amount of hair was noted and was causing endobronchial obstruction at the level of graft leading to mucus trapping.  These were mechanically removed with forceps (excision of lesion due to obstruction).
 
There were significant granulation tissue that was noted and APC was used to ablate the granulation issue to reduce obstruction. Endobronchial obstruction at Subglottic was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	1.5mm 	Pulse 20 effect 2, flow 0.3	2-3 sec 	ablated
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 60% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Bonastent 14x60
BAL RML
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 29 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stenosis.
- critical airway watch for overnight 
- consider CPAP overnight if get into respiratory failure
- f/u in am with CXR

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at Right Mainstem.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
