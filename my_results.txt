NOTE_ID:  note_279 SOURCE_FILE: note_279.txt 
 
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 37 year old-year-old female who presents with tracheal stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal stenosis
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Tracheal stenosis
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision 
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP  CODE MOD DETAILS: Unusual Procedure:
This patient required multiple modalities for relief of tracheal stenosis. This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). 
 

 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Tracheoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Not fully assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Proximal tracheal with concentric stenosis
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
TRACHEAL STENOSIS

 
After induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The red rigid (tracheoscope) barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Trachea (Proximal 1/3) was treated with the following modalities:
 

Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Results
Mechanical	Red Tracheoscope
 
2.0mm  Pulmonary Forceps
 
2.8mm Large Capacity Forceps	N/A
 
 
N/A
 
 
 
N/A
 	Excellent relief of stenosis
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 20% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 40% patent. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 30 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
TRACHEAL STENOSIS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEDURE
 

 

 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--Forceps biopsies
--RML BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]  is a 37 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of tracheal stenosis. Patient was noted to have tracheal stenosis at the subglottic space/proximal 1/3 of the trachea. The patient's stenosis was relieved with dilation using the rigid tracheoscope barrel and via forceps. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--Post procedure CXR
--Follow up BAL results
--Follow-up in outpatient Interventional Pulmonology clinic as scheduled on 1/20/2026
--Repeat bronchoscopy in appx 1 month with Cryospray available

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 57 year old-year-old female who presents with COPD for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J44.9 COPD
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J44.9 COPD
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance 
31647 Bronchial valve insert initial lobe 
31651 Bronchial valve insert additional lobe
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required endobronchial valve placement in multiple lobes. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance 
31647 Bronchial valve insert initial lobe 
31651 Bronchial valve insert additional lobe.

Support Staff: 
RN: Maribel Dean
RT: Maria Aries
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The endotracheal tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Balloon Occlusion was performed to confirm lobe selection.
‌ YES

Chartis System was used to confirm no collateral ventilation 
‌ YES
 
Airleak stop or reduced was confirmed
‌ YES
 
The following lobes were intervened:
‌ Right Upper 
‌ Right Middle 

 
The following valve were used:
‌ Spiration (Olympus)
‌ Zephyr (Pulmonx)
 
Valve sizes used and corresponding segments below:
 

Airway	Valve
RUL apical and posterior subsegments (RB1 and RB3)	Zephyr size 5.5
RUL anterior subsegment (RB2)	Zephyr size 5.5
RML medial subsegment	Spiration size 9
RML lateral subsegment	Spiration size 7
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Medial-basal Segment of RLL (RB7).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--RLL BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 57 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for placement of endobronchial valves for lung volume reduction. Patient had Zephyr valves placed at the RUL and Spiration valves placed in the RML. She tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.
 
--Post procedure CXR
--Follow up BAL results
--Hospital admission for observation/PTX watch

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID: note_358	SOURCE_FILE: note_358.txt
PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and TBBX under moderate sedation
INDICATION : Lung Transplant 
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical proffesional.
 
MONITORING : Continuous telemetry, BP and oxygen saturation monitored
INSTRUMENT : Olympus Video Bronchoscope
ANESTHESIA : Moderate IV sedation with: fentanyl 75 mcg and Versed 3 mg; Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~8ml via adomizer
Sedation time was 15 min during this procedure
 
 
Time out: Immediately prior to procedure a time out was called to verify the correct patient, procedure, equipment, support staff and site/side  marked as required.  
 
SUMMARY : Initially a time-out was performed prior to the procedure, confirming the patient's name, procedure type and procedure location. After the patient was properly positioned and sedated and topical anesthesia applied, the bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth with O2 being administered at all times. This was done without difficulty. The bronchoscope was passed by the carina, which was examined for sharpness, position and texture. The bronchial orifices were systematically identified, evaluated and suctioned free of secretions and close attention was paid to color, texture, positions, size and patency.

INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
 
DATE OF PROCEDURE: [REDACTED]
 
 
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents with hemoptysis and respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
 
ATTENDING:  
[REDACTED]
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Continued IV infusions with 2 mg dilaudid bolus
 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Bloody secretions and blood clot noted at right-sided airways, particularly RML and RB6 subsegment. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Stent well-seated at LMSB with distal end at LLL truncus basalis. Moderate bloody as well as clear secretions. LUL and LB6 jailed off by stent, otherwise normal anatomic branching to segmental level.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear with some blood.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
Blood secretions in the RML
Thin, white-yellow mucus in the LLL antero-medial, lateral and posterior segments
Defect seen in stent at 2 o'clock position with bubbling from it
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airways and reassessment of stent position and hemoptysis. Tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--Plan for repeat bronchoscopy in OR later this week for endobronchial blocker placement (plan for Amplatzer vascular plug)
--Continue stent hydration
--Continued care per primary team

Target 1: RML
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Lateral Segment of RML (RB4).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 21-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11L lymph node
 
Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Suggestive of benign-appearing lymphoid tissue
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Final results are pending.
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Suggestive of benign-appearing lymphoid tissue. Final results are pending.
 
Site 3: The 11Rs lymph node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis. Final results are pending.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID:  note_274 SOURCE_FILE: note_274.txt 
DATE OF PROCEDURE: 
[REDACTED]
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure and recurrent hemoptysis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required increased time and effort for selective fiberoptic intubation of the right-sided airways and manipulation/revision of the vascular plug. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     . 
ATTENDING:  
[REDACTED]
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Copious secretions noted throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: LUL with vascular plug in place with overlying mucus. Vascular plug noted not to be completely occlusing LUL airways with gap at the 10 o'clock position. Copious thick and thin secretions throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Copious thick and thin secretions throughout.  
DISTAL LUL AIRWAYS VISIBLE PAST VASCULAR PLUG

 

 

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus. 
Fiberoptic intubation via oral pathway was performed to introduce a 5.0 MLT ETT into the right mainstem bronchus, thus securing ventilation to the right-sided airways in case of hemoptysis. This was done due to high risk of bleeding from the LUL known aspergilloma
Next, pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the vascular plug and bring it more proximally and ensure complete occlusion of the LUL.
VIEW OF VASCULAR PLUG AFTER REVISION

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of vascular plug at the LUL. The vascular plug was found to not be fully occluding the airway. Pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the plug and pull it proximally into a position allowing for complete occlusion of the LUL.
--CT chest now to eval non-visible sections of the vascular plug and assess possibility of future migration
--Continued care per primary team

INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
DATE OF PROCEDURE: 
 [REDACTED]
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required increased time and effort for selective fiberoptic intubation of the right-sided airways and manipulation/revision of the vascular plug. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31500 Intubation, endotracheal, emergency procedure
31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent     . 
ATTENDING:  
[REDACTED]
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
Dexmedetomidine gtt  1.5mcg/kg/h
Propofol gtt                  20mcg/kg/min
Dilaudid gtt                  4mg/h
Vecuronium gtt9mg/h
Midazolam gtt              8mg/h
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Copious secretions noted throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: LUL with vascular plug in place with overlying mucus. Copious thick and thin secretions throughout. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Copious thick and thin secretions throughout.  
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood clots. 
Fiberoptic intubation via oral pathway was performed to introduce a 5.0 MLT ETT into the right mainstem bronchus, thus securing ventilation to the right-sided airways in case of hemoptysis. This was done due to high risk of bleeding from the LUL known aspergilloma 
Pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the vascular plug and bring it more proximally and ensure complete occlusion of the LUL. 
VIEW OF VASCULAR PLUG AFTER REVISION 

 

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchoscopy for evaluation of vascular plug at the LUL. Pulmonary forceps were used to grasp the plug and pull it proximally into a position allowing for complete occlusion of the LUL with less likelihood for migration.
--Initiation of awakening trials, sedation weaning
--Daily bronchoscopies for now to eval vascular plug/hemoptysis
--Gentle in-line suctioning
--Continued care per primary team

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and TBBX under moderate sedation
INDICATION : Lung Transplant 

 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical proffesional.
 
MONITORING : Continuous telemetry, BP and oxygen saturation monitored
INSTRUMENT : Olympus Video Bronchoscope
ANESTHESIA : Moderate IV sedation with: fentanyl 50 mcg IV and Versed 2 mg IV; Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~8ml via adomizer
Sedation time was 15 min during this procedure
Sedation start time 09:06 AM
Sedation end time 09:21 AM
 
Time out: Immediately prior to procedure a time out was called to verify the correct patient, procedure, equipment, support staff and site/side  marked as required.  
 
SUMMARY : Initially a time-out was performed prior to the procedure, confirming the patient's name, procedure type and procedure location. After the patient was properly positioned and sedated and topical anesthesia applied, the bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth with O2 being administered at all times / with the patient continuously on the ventilator. This was done without difficulty. The bronchoscope was passed by the carina, which was examined for sharpness, position and texture. The bronchial orifices were systematically identified, evaluated and suctioned free of secretions and close attention was paid to color, texture, positions, size and patency.

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Regrowth of polyp in the proximal third of trachea was noted.   There were distal airway polyp noted on the lateral side of the tracheal wall (right side).  These cluster disease areas were treated with soft coag. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Vocal Cord, Subglottic, Trachea (Proximal 1/3), and Trachea (Distal 1/3) was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	2.3mm probe	Soft coag	4sec	Ablated and removed
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7mm	Cryotherapy	15 sec freeze thaw, mutliple cycles	treated
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 50% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 80% patent. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- none 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 49 year old-year-old adult who presents for bronchoscopy for airway polyp removal.
- return in 1 month for airway inspection

NOTE_ID: note_294	SOURCE_FILE: note_294.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 59 year old-year-old male who presents with PNA.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
 
25 Added to the E&M Encounter bill which is separate from a procedure if it is done the same day
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local ONLY
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The oropharynx and vocal cords appear normal. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. Moderate clear secretions on the left, copious thick clear and white secretions in the right airways, largely in RLL. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, RML Carina (RC2), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior-basal Segment of RLL (RB8).  Instilled 80 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- RLL BAL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 59 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for PNA.
 
- f/u BAL studies
- cont secretion clearance protocol

PROCEDURE: Flexible Bronchoscopy, Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) and Transbronchial Lung Biopsies under moderate sedation
INDICATION : S/P Lung transplant for airway (anastomosis) evaluation and evaluation for subclinical lung rejection
  
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
  
MONITORING : Continuous telemetry, BP and oxygen saturation monitored
INSTRUMENT : Olympus Video Bronchoscope
ANESTHESIA : Moderate IV sedation with: Fentanyl 50 mcg, midazolam (versed) 5 mg; Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~ 3 ml via nebulizer + 4 mL via atomizer + 8 mL direct instillation.
  
SUMMARY : Initially a time-out was performed prior to the procedure, confirming the patient's name, procedure type and procedure location. Topical anaesthesia using nebulized 2% lidocaine was given via a mouth piece + an atomizer. The patient was properly positioned and with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula in place, conscious sedation was achieved using small doses of iv midazolam and iv fentanyl.  The bronchoscope was then introduced through the mouth with O2 being administered at all times. This was done without difficulty. The bronchoscope was passed by the vocal cords, the trachea and then the carina, which was examined for sharpness, position and texture. The bronchial orifices were systematically identified, evaluated and suctioned free of secretions. Close attention was paid to color, texture, positions, size and patency of the airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage was then performed with 140 mL of normal saline instilled to right lower lobe followed by aspiration from same site till clear. Transbronchial biopsies were then obtained. A total of 10 biopsies were performed (2 from RUL, 4 from RML, and 4 from RLL). Bleeding was controlled with saline lavage and bronchoscope tamponade as needed.  Once the bleeding is determined to be controlled, the bronchoscopy was withdrawn out.
  
FINDINGS

2. BAL sample sent for cultures (bacteria, fungal and AFB), galactomannan, and cytology.
3. Transbronchial biopsies sent for pathology and C4d stain
 
Complications: None
 
Sedation Time:
Sedation started at 11:07 AM
Sedation ended at 11:23 AM
 
Post procedure:
1. Activities:  Able to move 4 extremities voluntarily in command
2. Respiration:  Able to breath deeply and cough freely
3. Circulation: BP +/- 20 mm Hg of pre-anesthesia level

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 80 year old-year-old male who presents with Recurrent Effusion.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound, Tunnel Pleural Catheter Placement, and Thoracoscopy with biopsy and chemical pleurodesis were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32609 Thoracoscopy; with biopsy(ies) of pleura
32650 Thoracoscopy, surgical; with pleurodesis (eg, mechanical or chemical)
 
SEDATION: MAC per Anesthesia
  
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.

ANESTHESIA:   Lidocaine 1%: 10 ml      
Entry Site: 
? Right 6th Intercostal Space   
Posterior-axillary  ?
PROCEDURE FINDINGS: 
A time-out was performed in which the patient, operative procedure and operative sites were confirmed among with the nursing, surgical and anesthesia teams.  
 
The skin and underlying tissue at the proposed trocar insertion site was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. A skin incision of approximately 1cm was made in the 6th intercostal space in the posterior axillary line. The pleural space was accessed under direct visualization using the rigid pleuroscope with optical trocar over the superior border of the lower rib to avoid neuromuscular bundle injury.
 
Initial thoracoscopic survey demonstrates no nodularity along the anterior or posterior chest wall no atop the diaphragm. There is some anthracotic pigment atop the diaphragm and at the visualized lung. Biopsies of the posterior chest wall/parietal pleura were obtained with the use of the cupped and curved rigid forceps.

General Anesthesia

 
ANESTHESIA: 
Local anesthesia with: SEE MAR
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   30mL
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted into the LMA and advanced through the vocal cords into the airway. Bilateral airway inspection showed complex stenosis and malacic area at anastomosis on left mainstem. Right anastomosis was normal with a clip visible in the airway lumen. The anatomic segmental branching was normal. There was granulation tissue partially obstruction left anastomosis from 10 o clock to 5 o clock position. 
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at Left Mainstem anastomosis.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Endobronchial obstruction at Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	2.4mm	30 s freeze and thaw cycle 4 applications 10 o clock, 12 o clock 2o clock 4 o clock	 	Improved luminal patency
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60s seconds each.
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 60% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 80% patent. 
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8) and Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9).  Total 8 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 
LLL TBBx
LMSB EBBx
Lingula BAL
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 69 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial stenosis and Tbbx to rule out rejection
 
[ ] cxr in pacu
[ ] Stenosis is complex and partially malacic with some granulation tissue. Will likely need a stent trial in short interval, follow up in clinic

ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. Lidocaine was applied to the airway.
 
The trachea, left lung, right upper lobe, and right middle lobe were normal appearing except for patches of anthracosis throughout the airway.
 
The right lower lobe superior segment was completely obstructed by tumor. 
Narrowband imaging was used to inspect the airway and tumor, no excess blood vascularity was noted. 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
Left upper lobe mass and Right lower lobe mass
 
Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Positive for malignancy
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of anthracosis. Final results are pending.
 
Site 2: The left upper lobe mass was => 10 mm on CT and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 8 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 3 elastographic pattern, predominantly stiff (blue), raising concern for malignancy. Based on this finding, the lymph node was prioritized for TBNA with multiple passes obtained to maximize diagnostic yield.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.
 
Site 3: The 11Ri lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 5 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as not adequate and suggestive of Specimen was inadequate for ROSE analysis . Final results are pending.
 
Site 4: The Right lower lobe mass was => 10 mm on CT and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.
 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at right lower lobe superior segment was treated with the following modalities:

Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.1 mm	 	5-15 seconds	Cryo adhesion and ablation
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 100% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 80% patent. 
 
After tumor ablation, the airway was probed with forceps and dilated. Thick mucus was irrigated and suctioned out. 
 
The airways beyond were distorted.
 
Alligator forceps were used to perform further excision at the right lower lobe superior segment. 
 
Iced saline was used to control bleeding.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2), Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3), Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4), and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Transbronchial Cryo biopsies. This resulted in >50% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31628 TBBX single lobe     . 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. There were thick secretions noted and suctioned.
The right upper lobe had early bifurcation of the segmental airways.
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	 	300	12	100	10	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2).  Target lesion is about 2 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is eccentric after biopsies.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 8 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Cells present causing suspicion of malignant neoplasm
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Apical Segment of RUL (RB1), Posterior Segment of RUL (RB2), and Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1 3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 7 (subcarinal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 2: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 3: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicatedEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken.
 
Site 4: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given the size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not taken.
 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and blood. 
 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope was advanced for airway examination.  Endobronchial topical lidocaine applied to the vocal cords, main carina, right carina 1, and left carina 2.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
 
Initial Airway Examination Findings:
 
There were a weblike obstruction in the airways arrowed 6mm at the distal end of LMS near LC2. 
 
 
Endobronchial obstruction at left carina 2, left upper lobe take-off, and LMS was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	knife	Endocut I	1-3 seconds	Cut was done at the LUL and LMS
 
Proximal left mainstem bronchus was treated with Balloon dilation was performed at LMS.  12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 13.5 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 120 seconds each.
 
Balloon dilation was performed at left upper lobe bronchus stenosis.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8mm at the left upper lobe bronchus stenosis.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 120 seconds each.  
 
Minimal bleeding from procedures above easily controlled with suction and cold saline flushes.
 
Prior to treatment, proximal left mainstem bronchus was note to be 40% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 80% patent.  
Prior to treatment, left upper lobe bronchus was note to be 30% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 50% patent.  
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED]is a 64 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stenosis.
 
- continue stent free trial
- return to bronch evaluation in 12 weeks 
- intro to Dr. Laura Frye at UT Southwest.

CC Referred Physician:  Provider, Not In System, MD
No address on file
 
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 65 year old-year-old male who presents with need for tracheostomy replacement
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheostomy
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Tracheostomy
 
PROCEDURE:  
31502 Tracheotomy tube change prior to establishment of fistula tract

 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 
Upper airway was suctioned and cleared.  Endotracheal suctioning performed.  The cuff was deflated and the tracheostomy tube was easily removed.  The stoma appeared widely patent and no granulation tissue was immediately visualized.  The new tracheostomy tube was then placed with obturator in place.  The obturator was removed, inner cannula was placed. 
 
Percutaneous tracheostomy was changed from:
Portex cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 8.0mm
 
To 
Portex uncuffed Trach ISO/ID size 7.0mm
 
without issue.
 
 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 65 year old-year-old male who presents for trach downsizing. 
 
- call IP back if needs decannulation of trach

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED]is a 50 year old-year-old female who presents with airway stent.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The airway was inspected. Lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the airway. The vocal cords were normal appearing.
 
The stent remained in good position, there was still some over hang at the main carina. The right mainstem, right upper lobe, and the right bronchus intermedius stent segments were patent in the Y stent. There were secretions and these were suctioned.
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED]is a 50 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stent inspection.
 
-Follow up in clinic to reassess symptoms and plan for follow up bronchoscopy in 4-8 weeks for stent check

NOTE_ID: note_334	SOURCE_FILE: note_334.txt
INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
 

 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appear normal. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. RMSB anastomosis was well healed and patent. The LMSB stent was in good position, partially occluded (~50%) by mucus. There was some granulation tissue at the proximal and distal edge of the stent. Moderate to large burden of white secretions in the left airways. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Left Mainstem, LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Endobronchial obstruction at LMSB (proximal and distal edge of stent) was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	2.4mm probe	 	30sec freeze and thaw	Ablation
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 80% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- LLL BAL 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED] is a 61 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial stenosis.
 
- f/u BAL results
- repeat stent evaluation in 2 months

INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 80 year old-year-old male who presents with Recurrent Effusion.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Tunnel Pleural Catheter Placement were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32550 Insertion of indwelling tunneled pleural catheter with cuff
 
Mod 62 Co-surgeons performing separate parts of the procedure

 
SEDATION: MAC per Anesthesia

 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.

PROCEDURE FINDINGS: 
A guidewire was inserted through the pleuroscopy insertion site (see separate documentation for pleuroscopy).  A 5mm skin incision was made approximately 5 cm away from the guidewire insertion site.  The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue.  The introducer sheath was placed and the guidewire removed.  The catheter was then placed into the pleural space via the introducer sheath. The pleural entry site was closed with an absorbable suture.  The catheter was secured to the skin using 2-0 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.
