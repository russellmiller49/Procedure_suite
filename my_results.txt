NOTE_ID:  note_235 SOURCE_FILE: note_235.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Bronchus-intermedius obstruction secondary to Broncholithiasis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	 Resolved Bronchus-intermedius obstruction 
2.	 Mild stricture of bronchus intermedius  
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.	CPT 31630 Bronchoscopy with tracheal/bronchial dilation
1.	INDICATIONS:  1.Bronchus-intermedius obstruction secondary to broncholith
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem and right upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was no evidence of recurrent broncholith, there was approximately 20% obstruction from stricturing on the medial aspect along with pinpoint healing defect associated with area of previous broncholith erosion. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Balloon dilatation was performed with the 12/13.5/15cm dilation dilatational balloon within the bronchus intermedius resulting in reduction of obstruction to approximately 5%. There was no significant bleeding. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure complete. 
Complications: None
Estimated blood loss: 1cc
Specimens: none
Recommendations:
- Admit to IM ward due as patient does not have anyone locally to observe post-anesthesia 
- Advance diet as tolerated.
- Likely D/C in AM
- OK to return to Japan without duty limitation.

STATUS: SUCCESS

================================================================================
NOTE: note_247
================================================================================

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_247 SOURCE_FILE: note_247.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  Timothy Grace is a 56 year old-year-old male with cystic fibrosis who presents with a cavitary lesion in right lower lobe.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.

CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule
PROCEDURE:  
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
  
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed to confirm the patient’s identity, the procedure, and the location.
Following administration of intravenous medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, a P190 hybrid video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea appeared normal. The bronchoscope was advanced to the main carina, which was noted to have a sharp angle. The scope was then directed into the left mainstem bronchus, allowing visualization of all segments and subsegments of the left upper lobe, lingula, and lower lobe; no abnormalities were identified on the left side. The bronchoscope was withdrawn to the trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. All segments and subsegments of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes were examined. Purulent material was observed emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The bronchoscope was wedged in this segment, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 60 cc of instilled saline, yielding 20 cc of return fluid. During the lavage, a cavity was visualized in the superior segment of the right lower lobe containing a well-demarcated soft tissue mass with a granular texture, consistent with a mycetoma. The right airway anatomy was notable for fusion of the apical and posterior segments in the right upper lobe; aside from the cavity, no additional masses or lesions were identified. After thorough inspection, multiple forceps biopsies were obtained from the mass within the cavity. Moderate bleeding ensued and was effectively managed with 4 cc of epinephrine, 30 cc of iced saline, and wedging of the scope in the affected segment, which successfully controlled the hemorrhage.
The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure was completed without further incident. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications. At the conclusion, he was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL from right lower lobe: Sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, cytology, and galactomannan.
Right lower lobe forceps biopsy: Sent for pathology and culture.
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Timothy Grace is a 56 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe.
•	Transfer to PACU
•	Obtain chest X-ray
•	Discharge home once cleared by PACU
•	Await pathology results.

NOTE_ID:  note_104 SOURCE_FILE: note_104.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
50 Bilateral Procedures (Procedure done on both sides of the body)
IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a bilateral procedure today when this procedure would typically be unilateral. Apply to: 31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    . 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The airway was inspected from above the tracheostomy tube. The vocal cords were normal appearing. The trach was in good position and the balloon was inflated. Secretions were suctioned and lidocaine was applied.
The airway was inspected via the tracheostomy. The right sided stent was in good position. There was significant necrosis/granulation tissue around the suture site and medially along the transplanted lung. This covered the orifice of the right middle lobe. The right lower lobe was preserved. The portion of the right upper lobe take off visible through the stent appeared intact, but there was an area around 9 o'clock which could be injured.
The left lung anastamosis site had similar medial necrosis and granulation tissue. The lingula was patent but obscured with the necrosis. The left upper lobe anterior segment had some necrosis and the left upper lobe proper was preserved. The left lower lobe was preserved.
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RML Carina (RC2).  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology. 
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2).  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm and to 9 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Right middle lobe BAL
Right middle lobe EBBX
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure and airway dilation.
-Follow up bronchoscopic lab work
-Follow up bronchoscopy later this week or early next week

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	14	300	12	100	10	15
 
RUL Target:
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
No evidence of a malignant neoplasm
 
RLL Target:
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Segment of RLL (RB6).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Concentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS no sampling was done as none met biopsy criteria.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
10R lymph node
10L lymph node
11Rs lymph node
11Ri lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
