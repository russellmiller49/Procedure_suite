NOTE_ID:  note_168 SOURCE_FILE: note_168.txt Indications: Mediastinal Adenopathy with concern for brain mets
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. There was partial dynamic obstruction of the trachea of unclear etiology.  The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.  Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes were seen in multiple stations in relatively symmetric pattern. Mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed by transbronchial needle aspiration with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node followed by the 4L lymph node and finally the 2R lymph node.  A total of 5 biopsies were performed in each station (station 2R 7 samples were collected). ROSE evaluation yielded multiple granulomas from the 11L, 4L and 2R stations and adequate lymphocytes from station 7. All samples were sent for routine cytology and two additional samples were taken for AFB and fungal culture from the station 2R. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood there and secretions there was some slow oozing seen in the bilateral lower lobes. 2ml of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine were instilled into each lower lobe and the bleeding stopped. Once we were confident that there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10ml

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

NOTE_ID:  note_247 SOURCE_FILE: note_247.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  Timothy Grace is a 56 year old-year-old male with cystic fibrosis who presents with a cavitary lesion in right lower lobe.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.

CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule
PROCEDURE:  
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
  
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed to confirm the patient’s identity, the procedure, and the location.
Following administration of intravenous medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, a P190 hybrid video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea appeared normal. The bronchoscope was advanced to the main carina, which was noted to have a sharp angle. The scope was then directed into the left mainstem bronchus, allowing visualization of all segments and subsegments of the left upper lobe, lingula, and lower lobe; no abnormalities were identified on the left side. The bronchoscope was withdrawn to the trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. All segments and subsegments of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes were examined. Purulent material was observed emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The bronchoscope was wedged in this segment, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 60 cc of instilled saline, yielding 20 cc of return fluid. During the lavage, a cavity was visualized in the superior segment of the right lower lobe containing a well-demarcated soft tissue mass with a granular texture, consistent with a mycetoma. The right airway anatomy was notable for fusion of the apical and posterior segments in the right upper lobe; aside from the cavity, no additional masses or lesions were identified. After thorough inspection, multiple forceps biopsies were obtained from the mass within the cavity. Moderate bleeding ensued and was effectively managed with 4 cc of epinephrine, 30 cc of iced saline, and wedging of the scope in the affected segment, which successfully controlled the hemorrhage.
The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure was completed without further incident. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications. At the conclusion, he was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition.
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL from right lower lobe: Sent for respiratory and fungal cultures, AFB, cytology, and galactomannan.
Right lower lobe forceps biopsy: Sent for pathology and culture.
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: Timothy Grace is a 56 year old-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of a cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe.
•	Transfer to PACU
•	Obtain chest X-ray
•	Discharge home once cleared by PACU
•	Await pathology results.

NOTE_ID:  note_160 SOURCE_FILE: note_160.txt Procedure Name: 
1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy
Indications: Pulmonary Nodule
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The arytenoids were large with a large and floppy epiglottis. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. Tracheomalacia was noted as we advanced the scope to the carina. The carina was sharp. The right and left sided airway anatomy was normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments.  We then removed the bronchoscope and inserted the EBUS bronchoscope into the airway. We attempted to visualize the nodule with endobronchial ultrasound but did not see the nodule with ultrasound. We then inserted the therapeutic bronchoscope for electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy.  We were not able to get to the nodule using the navigation equipment.  After suctioning blood and secretions and once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.

Complications: None.
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 10 cc.  No specimens were obtained for path review.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Discuss his case at cardiothoracic tumor board next Tuesday to determine best next step in workup

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	15	350	16	100	10	20
 
RLL:
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Segment of RLL (RB6).  Target lesion is about 0.5 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 10 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
LLL:
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Target lesion is about 0.5 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 7 (subcarinal) node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis."

NOTE_ID:  note_124 SOURCE_FILE: note_124.txt PROCEDURE NOTE

Pre-operative diagnosis: RLL consolidation

Post-operative diagnosis: SAA

Procedure: Bronchoscopy with EBUS + TBNA + lung biopsy of RLL

CPT Code(s):
CPT 31653 Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided transtracheal and/or transbronchial sampling 3 or more structures.
CPT 31625 Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with bronchial or endobronchial biopsy(s), single or multiple sites
CPT 31628 Bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic guidance for transbronchial lung biopsy(s), single lobe

Bronchoscopes: Olympus H190, convex EBUS

Anesthesia: General per Anesthesia in addition to 6cc of 1% topical lidocaine

Time out: 1349

Scope in: 1350

Scope out: 1501

Estimated blood loss: 5cc

Fluids administered: None

PROCEDURE:

History and physical has been performed. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained.

Patient identification and proposed procedure were verified by the physician, anesthesia team, nurse, and pulmonary team. The patient was brought to the operating suite. Under general anesthesia, endotracheal tube was placed by anesthesiologist. The bronchoscope was introduced through an 8.5 endotracheal tube where lidocaine 1% was instilled onto trachea and airways. The tracheo-bronchial tree was then examined to at least the first subsegmental level. The endobronchial scope was then advanced in a similar fashion and mediastinal lymph nodes were identified and measured in a systematic fashion (see measurements below).

Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed at enlarged nodal stations with adequate tissue confirmed by ROSE (see sizes below).

Finally, inspection bronchoscopy was performed. 

The procedure was accomplished without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

FINDINGS: The vocal cords are normal and move normally with breathing. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree of bilateral lungs was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. All segmentals of the RLL appeared significantly stenotic and with nodular mucosa concerning for malignancy. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes were measured and sampled as below.

Node stations and sizes were as follows:

4L - 5.5mm, 4 passes
4R - 6.0mm
7 - 7.5mm, 8 passes
11Rs - 4.9mm

After nodal sampling was completed, forceps were used to biopsy the RLL. 2 samples were taken from the medial segment, 2 samples were taken from the anterior segment and 2 samples were taken from the superior segment.

SPECIMENS SENT TO THE LABORATORY:
--TBNA of 4L node station
--TBNA of 7 node station
-- Forceps Biopsies of the RLL (6 passes)

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision 
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)

22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a significant airway management and endobronchial hair removal. This resulted in >40% increased work due to Increased intensity, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision . 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Airway noted to be stable with significant airway pressure.  Stent was noted to be migrated distally. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Foreign body (stent) was noted in the distal trachea.  BonaStent (14x60) was removed with forceps. 
 
Significant amount of hair was noted and was causing endobronchial obstruction at the level of graft leading to mucus trapping.  These were mechanically removed with forceps (excision of lesion due to obstruction).
 
There were significant granulation tissue that was noted and APC was used to ablate the granulation issue to reduce obstruction. Endobronchial obstruction at Subglottic was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	1.5mm 	Pulse 20 effect 2, flow 0.3	2-3 sec 	ablated
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 60% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 90% patent. 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Bonastent 14x60
BAL RML
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 29 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stenosis.
- critical airway watch for overnight 
- consider CPAP overnight if get into respiratory failure
- f/u in am with CXR

NOTE: note_153

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_153 SOURCE_FILE: note_153.txt Indications: Hilar adenopathy, presumed metastatic breast CA
Procedure Performed: EBUS bronchoscopy single station.
Pre-operative diagnosis: hilar adenopathy 
Post-operative diagnosis: malignant hilar adenopathy 
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically suspicious station 11Ri lymph node. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

NOTE_ID:  note_095 SOURCE_FILE: note_095.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with airway stenosis.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Flexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
There were significant stenosis noted at the lingula orifice. Mild stenosis at the RMS anastomosis and BI.
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
Endobronchial obstruction at Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and lingula orifice was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	Needle knife	Effect 4, 40W	2-3 sec radial cuts	At lingula, RMS
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at Bronchus Intermedius .  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology.
Balloon dilation was performed at Right Mainstem.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Right Mainstem.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each. Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 80% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
Balloon dilation was performed at lingula.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
The following stent (aero mini 6x10) was placed in the lingula orifice. Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 20% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
none
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway stenosis.
- f/u in 2 weeks for repeat bronch
