NOTE_ID:  note_023 SOURCE_FILE: note_023.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 74 year old-year-old female who presents with hemoptysis after bronchoscopy.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: hemoptysis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  hemoptysis
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
ANESTHESIA: 
Continuous sedation
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: supine
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The bronchoscope was introduced into the ETT. The ETT is 2 cm above the main carina. The bronchial blocker was in the RLL but was mostly deflated without evidence of spill over into the other segments. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LLL and LMSB from mucus. 
The balloon was was fully deflated and then removed. Then a new 7 F Ardnt bronchial blocker was replaced through the existing ETT. The blocker was positioned in the distal BI. 3 mL of air was introduced into the blocker and resulted in occlusion of the BI without occlusion of the RUL. During exchange of the bronchial blocker there was no increase in the blood seen in the RLL lateral segment. This was no aspirated due to no obvious formed clot.
The bronchoscope was removed. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  
SPECIMEN(S): 
none
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 74 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for hemoptysis.
[ ] keep blocker in place at 40 cm at the connective device
[ ] ETT at 20 cm at the front tooth
[ ] stop paralysis once this is not effective stop fentanyl and repeat bronchoscopy at 1500 today
[ ] family updated

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_139 SOURCE_FILE: note_139.txt Procedure Name: Bronchoscopy
Indications: Multiple pulmonary nodules
Medications: Per anesthesia record

Pre-Procedure

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.

Following intravenous medications per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. The Q180 slim video bronchoscope was subsequently introduced via the same route.

Procedure Description / Findings

Post-radiation changes were noted involving the vocal cords and aryepiglottic folds. Papillomatous lesions were identified involving the right mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius. Abnormal mucosa was noted along the anterolateral aspect of the upper trachea, predominantly on the left side, with post-treatment changes extending to the mid-trachea. No clear papillomatous growth was identified in the distal airways.

The patient is status post prior endotracheal biopsies at abnormal papillomatous lesions involving the superior segment stump, proximal bronchus intermedius, and distal bronchus intermedius. The patient is also status post intratracheal injection of cidofovir (75 mg in 15 mL) at these sites.

Right Lung Abnormalities

A small, barely obstructing (less than 10% luminal obstruction) 8–10 mm polypoid lesion was identified proximally in the bronchus intermedius and in the superior segment of the right lower lobe (B6).

Narrow-band imaging was used for airway examination and demonstrated dotted abnormal vascular patterns in the proximal and distal bronchus intermedius. These lesions were biopsied.

Complications

No immediate complications.

Estimated Blood Loss

Minimal.

Post-Procedure Diagnosis

Endobronchial papillomatous lesions, status post biopsy

Recommendations

Follow up in clinic in 3 months.

Attending Participation

I was present and participated throughout the entire procedure, including non-key portions.

NOTE: note_260

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_260 SOURCE_FILE: note_260.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant lung mass with left lower lobe and partial left main-stem obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant airway obstruction 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with airway debulking
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  The proximal and mid left mainstem were normal. In the distal left mainstem a white fungating tumor was seen causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and extending from the left lower lobe bronchus to causing complete obstruction of the lingula and 80% obstruction of the left mainstem.  The LMA was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then utilized cryoextraction to remove large pieces of tumor piece meal. Most of the superficial tumor was avascular and did not bleed but as we continued debulking into less necrotic tumor mild bleeding occurred and was treated with cold saline flushes. After extensive debulking we were able to advance the bronchoscope into the lingula were some purulent secretions were seen and performed mini BAL. The tumor however extended into the subsegments of the lingula and deemed likely not salvageable with endobronchial treatment alone.  APC was then used to coagulate the residual superficial layer of oozing tumor. At the end of the procedure distal left mainstem was only 15% obstructed. The left upper lobe proper (anterior and apical posterior segments) were completely patent. The lingula was 80% obstructed and the left lower lobe remained completely obstructed with distal tumor. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Transfer to PACU and then home once discharge criteria met. 
Will discuss with oncology if biopsy samples obtained during procedure need any specific mutational analysis. 
Defer to oncology regarding medical and radiation treatment. 
Will monitor for symptoms or radiographic signs of tumor regrowth and possible need for repeat debulking to salvage left upper lobe.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_263 SOURCE_FILE: note_263.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tracheal stenosis
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Complex Tracheal stenosis s/p stent placement 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Tracheal self-expandable airway stent placement
INDICATIONS: Symptomatic tracheal stenosis
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Approximately 2.5 cm distal to the vocal cords was a long segment of circumferential complex stenosis measuring 3.5 cm with maximal airway obstruction of 90%.  Distal to the stenosis the mid and distal trachea appeared normal. All right and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were examined and normal without endobronchial disease or airway distortion. External markers were placed on the patient’s chest with fluoroscopic observation at the proximal and distal edges of the stenosis. At this point we inserted a JAG guidewire into the trachea through the flexible bronchoscope. The bronchoscope was then removed with the jagwire left in place. A 16x40 mm Ultraflex uncovered self-expandable metallic stent was then inserted over the guidewire and using the external markers positioned in proper place and then deployed. The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted. The stent was well positioned and partially compressed externally. A 14/16.5/18 mm Elation dilatational balloon was used to dilate the stent after which the airway was approximately 90% of normal caliber.  At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 

Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Discharge once criteria met.
- Plan for repeat evaluation and possible stent replacement in approximately 2 weeks.

NOTE_ID:  note_148 SOURCE_FILE: note_148.txt Procedure: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
Anesthesia Type: Previously tracheostomized and sedated
Indication: Hypoxemia
Consent: Emergent
Time-Out: Performed
Pre-Procedure Diagnosis: Emergent
Post-Procedure Diagnosis: Emergent
Medications: Patient previously sedated

Procedure Description

The Olympus Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the tracheostomy tube and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. A complete airway inspection was performed to at least the first subsegmental airways.

The right-sided airways were unremarkable, with only mildly edematous mucosa and clear secretions. The left-sided airways were similar, with the exception of purulent secretions pooling in the superior segment of the left lower lobe. The remaining airways were patent without significant central mucus plugging.

The bronchoscope was wedged into the superior segment of the left lower lobe, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with 60 mL of instilled saline and 20 mL of return. The bronchoscope was then withdrawn, and the procedure was completed.

Estimated Blood Loss: None
Complications: None
Specimens Sent: Bronchoalveolar lavage, left lower lobe
Implants: None

Follow-Up: Continue ICU-level care

INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Normal.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Mildly tortuous
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: The distal left mainstem bronchus was noted to be slightly stenotic (~8mm). Otherwise, there was normal anatomic branching to segmental level in the LLL, noting historic obliteration of LUL.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
DISTAL LEFT MAINSTEM BRONCHUS
 ]
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
On PEEP 0, the patient's airways were noted to have slight malacia <50% at the proximal and distal left mainstem bronchus.
 
MALACIA AT PROXIMAL LMSB

MALACIA AT DISTAL LMSB

DISTAL LMSB WITH AND WITHOUT PEEP (left and right, respectively)
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID:  note_176 SOURCE_FILE: note_176.txt Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy
Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy – single station CPT 31652
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A large, station 4R, lymph node was identified and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 19G Visioshot EBUS-TBNA needles with a total of 7 passes performed. Initial rapid onsite evaluation showed scattered lymphocytes but no evidence of malignancy or granuloma. We then placed the Olympus mini-forceps through the working channel of the EBUS scope and adnaved the forceps through a tract in the airway created by the EBUS needle. We were able to visualize the forceps using the EBUS ultrasound within the lymph node. We then closed and retracted the forceps. This was performed twice and touchpreps were made with the collected specimins which showed abundant non-caseating granulomas on rapid onsite pathological evaluation. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided needle and mini-forceps.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-procedural monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

NOTE_ID:  note_238 SOURCE_FILE: note_238.txt PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
CPT 31641 Bronchoscopy destruction of tumor or relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
CPT 31624 Bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage

INDICATIONS: Airway stent occlusion 

Sedation: General Anesthesia

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The patients known Silicone Y-stent was well positioned. There was signifigant thich dry mucous with mild obstruction of the tracheal limb, moderate obstruction of the left bronchial limb and significant obstruction of the right bronchial limb and the telescoping right mainstem covered metallic stent. The right upper lobe was partially obstructed by the distal tip of the SEM but there was no evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia and all right sided segmental airways were patent without endobronchial disease. On the left the distal mainstem, lower lobe bronchi were patient without evidence of endobronchial disease. At the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe takeoff there was partially obstructive endobronchial tumor causing approximately 40% reduction in caliber which did not warrant treatment at this time. Through a combination of mechanical debulking with the bronchoscope tip, forceps debulking and use of sodium bicarbonate instillation the adhesive mucous was slowly removed, with near complete recanalization of the stents. Subsequently a mini BAL was performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe with 40cc instillation and 30cc return. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 

Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Discharge once criteria met.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_147 SOURCE_FILE: note_147.txt Procedure Performed:
Left-sided pleuroscopy (medical thoracoscopy) with pleural fluid drainage, pleural biopsies, and tunneled pleural catheter placement

Indication:
Pleural effusion

Medications / Anesthesia:
Monitored anesthesia care

Pre-Anesthesia Assessment:

ASA Class III (severe systemic disease)

The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Pertinent laboratory studies and imaging were reviewed. A procedural time-out was performed.

The patient was positioned in the lateral decubitus position on the operating table with pressure points appropriately padded. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (ChloraPrep) and draped in the usual fashion.

Local Anesthesia

The pleural entry site was identified using ultrasound guidance. The entry site was infiltrated with 20 mL of 1% lidocaine.

Procedure Description

A 10-mm reusable primary port was placed on the left side at the sixth intercostal space in the mid-axillary line using a Veress needle technique. A 10.0-mm integrated pleuroscope was introduced through the incision and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was inspected via the primary port.

A total of approximately 1,700 mL of amber-colored pleural fluid was removed.

Findings

The pleura demonstrated multiple areas of visible tumor studding involving the parietal pleura, visceral pleura, and lung. The left lower lobe did not appear fully expanded and was atelectatic.

Biopsies

Biopsies of pleural tumor studding over the diaphragm were obtained using forceps and sent for histopathological examination. A total of 11 biopsies were obtained.

Pleural Catheter Placement

A 15.5-French PleurX catheter was placed in the pleural space over the diaphragm.

Dressing

The port site was dressed with a transparent dressing.

Complications:
None immediate

Estimated Blood Loss:
Minimal

Post-Procedure Diagnosis:
Suspected pleural metastasis

Post-Procedure Plan:

Observe post-procedure until discharge criteria are met

Obtain post-procedure chest radiograph

Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
Amphotericin 50mg in 20cc sterile water was instilled into the LUL with 10cc into the apico-posterior (LB1/2) subsegment and 10cc into the anterior (LB3) subsegment

Post-instillation, patient had mild ooze of fresh blood. TXA total 1000mg was applied directly into the LUL through the bronchoscope.  Formalized clot was then extracted with cryoprobe to relieve airway obstruction. 

Endobronchial clot at LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1) and Left Carina (LC2) was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Cryoprobe	1.1mm Cryoprobe	N/A	5-10 second freezes	Excellent clot removal
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  
SPECIMEN(S): 
none
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for for instillation of Amphotericin. Patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--Continued care per primary team
--May consider repeat instillation of Amphotericin on 1/5/2026 and possible clot extraction
