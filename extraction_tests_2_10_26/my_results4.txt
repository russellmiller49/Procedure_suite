NOTE_ID:  note_101 SOURCE_FILE: note_101.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
ANESTHESIA: 
Local ONLY
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for persistent pale plaque of tissue along the anterior wall of the RMSB/BI and RML orifice. The RMSB anastomosis continues to show a partially exposed hemoclip along the posterior membrane. The RML orifice is stenosed to ~75% of its normal patency. The LMSB anastomosis shows mild granulation tissue and similar pale soft tissue plaque along the anterior aspect of the distal LMSB. Segmental airways on the left are widely patent. Clear secretions bilaterally. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior-basal Segment of RLL (RB8).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- RLL BAL 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure and bronchial anastomotic dehiscence and stenosis.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_258 SOURCE_FILE: note_258.txt PROCEDURE TECHNIQUE: Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions, there was extrinsic compression noted in the superior segment of the left lower lobe which precluded deeper visual inspection of suspected endobronchial disease within the segment. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was met in station 11L lymph node. Further details regarding nodal size are in the table below.   The EBUS scope was positioned in the origin of the left lower lobe and turned posteriorly to visualize the lung mass abutting the airway which measured 31.5mm in short axis diameter. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE indicated adequate lymph node sampling. We then reintroduced the EBUS scope into the left lower lobe and visualized the mass abutting the airway and EBUS guided sampling was performed of the mass with the EBUSTBNA 21 gauge needle. ROSE evaluation yielded tissue concerning for malignancy. All samples were sent for routine cytology and additional needle passes were performed for molecular studies. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. There were no complications. Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_100 SOURCE_FILE: note_100.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure. 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
ANESTHESIA: 
Local ONLY
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Lidocaine applied to trachea, main carina, RMS, & LMS.
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for persistent pale plaque of tissue along the anterior wall of the RMSB/BI and RML orifice.   The previously seen metallic hemoclip near the RMS anastomosis posterior membrane is no longer present.  The RML orifice is now completely stenosed by overlying necrotic debris.  Unable to probe into the airway to achieve patency. The LMSB anastomosis shows mild granulation tissue and similar pale soft tissue plaque along the anterior aspect of the distal LMSB. Segmental airways on the left are widely patent. Clear secretions bilaterally. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, and RLL and LLL from mucus. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure and bronchial anastomotic dehiscence and stenosis. 
-Plan for bronchoscopy under GA for mngmnt of RML stenosis - likely excision of overlying debris, balloon dilation, and stent placement.  Likely on [REDACTED].

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_195 SOURCE_FILE: note_195.txt Procedure Name: Pleuroscopy
Indications: Pleural effusion
Medications: Fentanyl 3, versed 75, Lidocaine 30cc 1%
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the L lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  An 8 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. There was diffuse pleural studding observed. The pleura was gernerally unremarkable with the execution of a few white and yellow plaques as well as some mild tethering of the right upper lobe to the chest wall. Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination with approximately 5 total biopsies taken. There was brisk but transient bleeding after the initial biopsy ans subsequently protamine was given to completely reverse patients heparin (which was held for the procedure). The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly. 

PleurX Catheter Placement:

A guide wire was inserted into the site of pleuroscopy entry and the port was removed. A separate skin site was identified ~5cm inferior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <1cm incision was then performed. A subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.  The Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract, followed by dilatation of the pleural access tract with the 16 fr peel away sheath via seldinger technique. The Pleurx catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath. Both incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed. The catheter was subsequently connected to the drainage wall suction and <100cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained.  The catheter tip was then capped and the pleurx was dressed and covered with a transulent dressing. 

The patient tolerated the procedural well.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed minimal residual pleural air with
pleural catheter in place tracking upwards.  
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 20cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion 
Recommendation:
Will await pathology and microbiological studies
Patient education on pleural catheter draining and will return tomorrow for initial drainage.
Hold heparin drip until 6 hours post-procedure (19:00 tonight)

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required cryotherapy for removal of organized clot throughout the left-sided airways. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Versed gtt                    2 mg/hr
Versed boluses            10 mg total
Fentanyl gtt                 150 mcg/hr
Fentanyl boluses         125 mcg total
Propofol                       60 mg/kg/min
Dexmedatomidine       1 mcg/kg/hr
Cisatracurium              7 mg/hr
 
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   1156
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   1400
 
Total moderate sedation time was 124 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by ICU RN. 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Endobronchial balloon at ligula, LUL and LB6 with organized clot obscuring evaluation of distal airways. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
Endobronchial clot at LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1) and Left Carina (LC2) and LB6 was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Cryoprobe	1.1mm Cryoprobe	N/A	5-10 second freezes	Excellent clot removal
 
After organized clot was removed from the LUL, Amphotericin 10mg in 10cc sterile water was instilled into the LUL proper. The bronchoscope was wedged into the LUL to prevent backflow for 5 minutes.
 
TXA 400mg was applied directly into the LUL through the bronchoscope and balloon occlusion was performed at the Left Carina (LC2) with 5 Fr Uniblocker and secured in place with the Uniblocker ventilator adaptor.
            -Placed at 27.5cm at dark blue securement device
            -Confirmed that 2.5cc of air was required to inflate the balloon to fully occlude the 
LUL
The endobronchial blocker balloon was left inflated in the LUL.
 
CLOT REMOVED FROM LUL
 
 
UNIBLOCKER IN PLACE AT LUL AT CONCLUSION OF PROCEDURE
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of hemoptysis and instillation of antifungal medication (Amphotericin). A combination of cold saline and cryotherapy (cryoprobe) were used to evacuate the LUL and LB6 airways of organized clot. Amphotericin was instilled into the LUL and a 5 Fr Uniblocker was placed and left inflated at the LUL. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--Post procedure CXR
--Uniblocker placed at LUL orifice, inflated fully with 2.5cc of air, blocker distance at 27.5cm
--Please leave blocker in place for 2 hours post procedure (deflate at 1400 on [REDACTED])
--Plan for repeat bronchoscopy and likely repeat instillation of Amphotericin on [REDACTED]

Total notes tested: 5

Success rate: 100.0%
================================================================================
🩺 Extraction Quality Report
Overall Batch Score: 82 / 100 Summary: The pipeline demonstrates excellent precision on standard procedures (BAL, Aspiration, Thoracoscopy, IPC) but struggles with complex context disambiguation (Cryo for clot vs. biopsy; Balloon blocker vs. BLVR valve) and occasionally fails to link extracted entities to billable events (EBUS sampling).

1. Note: note_101
Score: 100 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None.

Mismatch: None.

Verification:

Text: "RML orifice is stenosed to ~75%" → JSON: pre_obstruction_pct: 75 (Exact match).

Text: "Instilled 40 cc... suction returned with 10 cc" → JSON: volume_instilled_ml: 40.0, volume_recovered_ml: 10.0 (Exact match).

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: None. correctly identified BAL and Therapeutic Aspiration.

Missed Details: Correctly captured "Anterior-basal Segment of RLL (RB8)" location.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

Generated: 31624 (BAL), 31646 (Therapeutic Asp).

Dropped: 31622 (Diagnostic) correctly bundled.

Logic: Valid. therapeutic_aspiration combined with bal is a common, valid scenario.

2. Note: note_258
Score: 50 / 100 Status: ❌ FAIL (Critical Recall Error)

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None.

Mismatch:

Registry vs Text: Text explicitly states "Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11L Lymph node" and "sampling was performed of the mass".

Registry Output: The JSON registry.procedures_performed.linear_ebus.node_events lists 11L as action: "inspected_only". This directly contradicts the text.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: Major Billing Miss. The pipeline failed to recognize the sampling aspect of the EBUS procedure.

Missed CPTs: Resulted in cpt_codes: []. Should have generated at least 31652 (EBUS 1-2 stations) or 31654 (Peripheral lesion).

3. Logic & Coding
Root Cause: The granular_data section correctly flagged sampled: true for 11L, but the node_events logic (which drives CPTs) downgraded it to "inspected_only", causing the billing engine to output zero codes.

3. Note: note_100
Score: 100 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None.

Context: Correctly identified that the RML stenosis intervention was attempted but failed ("Unable to probe"), and thus did not generate a dilation code (31630) or destruction code (31641).

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: None. Correctly captured "Therapeutic aspiration" (31646) which was successful in other airways.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

Generated: 31646.

Logic: Correctly interpreted "Unable to probe" as a failure for the specific stenosis intervention, relying on the successful aspiration for billing.

4. Note: note_195
Score: 100 / 100 Status: ✅ PASS

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations: None.

Details:

Text: "PleurX catheter Placement" → JSON: ipc.catheter_brand: "PleurX", tunneled: true.

Text: "Biopsies of the abnormal areas" → JSON: medical_thoracoscopy.biopsies_taken: true.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Procedures: None. Captured both the Thoracoscopy and the IPC placement.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

Generated: 32609 (Thoracoscopy w/ biopsy), 32550 (IPC insertion).

Logic: Perfect. NCCI edits allow these two distinct procedures (pleural space access vs. indwelling catheter).

5. Note: note_014
Score: 60 / 100 Status: ⚠️ WARNING (Context Confusion)

1. Accuracy (Precision)
Hallucinations / Misclassification:

Cryo Misclassification: JSON lists transbronchial_cryobiopsy: performed=true. Text says "Cryoprobe... Excellent clot removal". This is Therapeutic (Destruction/Relief), not a Biopsy.

Device Hallucination: JSON lists blvr.valve_type: "Spiration (Olympus)". Text says "5 Fr Uniblocker". A Uniblocker is a balloon blocker for isolation, not a Spiration BLVR valve.

2. Completeness (Recall)
Missed Details: Accurately captured the therapeutic aspiration and balloon occlusion, but mislabeled the devices/intent.

3. Logic & Coding
CPT Consistency:

Generated 31628 (Biopsy) incorrectly due to the cryobiopsy hallucination.

Generated 31634 (Balloon occlusion) correctly, though the attribution to BLVR logic is shaky.

Generated 31641 (Destruction) correctly, likely due to the "clot removal" being mapped to destruction, but the presence of both 31641 and 31628 for the same cryo tool is conflicting logic.

4. Corrected JSON Snippet (Registry)
