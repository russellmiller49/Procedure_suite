TITLE: Bronchoscopy with EMN navigation, radial EBUS localization, TBNA, TBLB, and BAL

INDICATION
Right upper lobe (RUL) spiculated peripheral pulmonary lesion, 2.5 cm; tissue diagnosis.

ANESTHESIA / SEDATION
Moderate sedation provided by the bronchoscopist with independent trained observer (RN Jones).
Start 10:12, Stop 10:47 (35 minutes total). Continuous monitoring documented.

PROCEDURE / TECHNIQUE
Flexible bronchoscopy via oral route. Full airway inspection.

NAVIGATION
Computer-assisted, image-guided navigation was INITIATED. CT plan loaded; navigation catheter advanced toward the RUL target; waypoint confirmation achieved. (Navigation initiated: YES.)

RADIAL EBUS (MINIPROBE)
Radial probe deployed to the RUL lesion; concentric view with “tool-in-lesion” confirmation captured as still images. Peripheral lesion localization completed.

SAMPLING
• TBNA: RUL lesion, 22G needle, 4 passes; ROSE adequate.
• Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB): RUL, 3 cryobiopsy passes with balloon-occlusion; fluoroscopy used.
• BAL: Right middle lobe (RML), 100 mL instilled, 50 mL returned.

COMPLICATIONS
None.

DISPOSITION
Stable to recovery. Images archived in the medical record.
