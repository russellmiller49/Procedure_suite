Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:

Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical-Posterior Segment of LUL (LB1/2).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
It was very difficult to engage the airway.  Peripheral fluoroscopy guided dilation was done with isohexol and a 4mm x 20mm mustang balloon was used to dilate open the airway and further advance the catheter. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 10 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 11Rs lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Sampled:
Site 1: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 2 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 
11R position appears to be a simple cyst that was drained after 2 passes. “
