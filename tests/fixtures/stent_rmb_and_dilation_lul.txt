TITLE: Bronchial stent in RMB and distinct-site dilation in LUL

INDICATION
Malignant central airway obstruction in the right main bronchus (RMB). Separate benign stenosis in the left upper lobe (LUL) segment.

ANESTHESIA
General anesthesia provided by anesthesia service.

PROCEDURE / TECHNIQUE
Rigid bronchoscopy. Full survey performed.

STENT (FIRST BRONCHUS)
Bronchial stent (covered metallic, 14×60 mm) placed in the RMB with standard deployment. Position confirmed bronchoscopically. Fluoroscopy used (bundled). No separate dilation within RMB beyond what is included in stent placement.

SEPARATE DILATION – DISTINCT SITE
Balloon dilation performed in the LUL segmental bronchus (not stented), 8 mm balloon at 8 atm, multiple inflations. This is a different airway than the RMB stented site.

COMPLICATIONS
None.

DISPOSITION
Stable to recovery. Bronchoscopic images saved showing RMB stent position and separate LUL dilation site.
