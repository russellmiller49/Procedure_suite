Thoracentesis was performed on the left hemithorax under ultrasound guidance.
Ultrasound identified a moderate pleural effusion with
anechoic echogenicity.
Following sterile prep and local anesthesia with 5 mL of 1% lidocaine,
a thoracentesis kit was used to access the pleural space at the
7th intercostal space along the mid-axillary line.
A total of 900 mL of serous fluid was removed.
Samples were sent for cell count, culture. A post-procedure chest x-ray was ordered. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
