INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [Patient Name] presents with a 22 mm RUL pulmonary nodule requiring histopathologic diagnosis.

CONSENT The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy and cryobiopsy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

RUL pulmonary nodule, 22 mm

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

RUL pulmonary nodule, 22 mm

PROCEDURE

Robotic navigational bronchoscopy (Ion) to RUL target
Tool-in-lesion confirmation
Transbronchial Cryobiopsy (RUL)
Cone-beam CT imaging with trajectory adjustment and confirmation
TBNA

ATTENDING [Name]
ASSISTANT [Name]
SUPPORT STAFF RN: [Name] RT: [Name]
INSTRUMENTATION Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform; TBNA needles; cryobiopsy system; cone-beam CT system.

ANESTHESIA General anesthesia

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimal

COMPLICATIONS None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, planned procedures, and laterality. Relevant procedural images were saved to the medical record.

Robotic navigation using the Ion platform to RUL target.

Tool-in-lesion was confirmed with Cone Beam CT.

A CBCT/CACT spin was obtained intra-procedurally.
Image fusion was performed to align intra-op imaging with the pre-procedure CT. The updated overlay demonstrated Cone Beam CT.
The patient tolerated the imaging without complications.

TBNA: Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed. Sampling was obtained from the RUL target.

Airway Inspection The bronchoscope was introduced and a systematic airway inspection was performed, noting normal anatomy without endobronchial lesions.

Radial EBUS & Preparation Attention was turned to the Right Upper Lobe (RUL).

rEBUS Survey: A radial EBUS probe was advanced to the basilar segments. The survey confirmed the absence of significant vessels at the selected biopsy sites and allowed for navigation to the periphery.

Transbronchial Cryobiopsy A cryoprobe was utilized for sampling.

Findings & Hemostasis

Hemostasis: Final airway inspection demonstrated no clinically significant bleeding.

Pneumothorax Check: Post-procedure assessment demonstrated no pneumothorax.

SPECIMENS

RUL Transbronchial Cryobiopsy — Histology

IMPRESSION / PLAN

Successful transbronchial cryobiopsy of RUL for ILD evaluation.

No pneumothorax or significant bleeding complications.

Recover per protocol; obtain post-procedure chest imaging to assess for late pneumothorax per local workflow.
