{"text": "PATIENT: Samuel Ortiz, 68-year-old Male\nMRN: 1904501\nDATE: 03/04/2025\nATTENDING: Dr. Priya Desai\nFELLOW: Dr. Michael Anders\nPROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of subcarinal lymph node (station 7) using Wang needle (CPT 31629)\nINDICATION: Right lower lobe lung mass with PET-avid subcarinal lymphadenopathy, mediastinal staging for suspected non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nANESTHESIA/SEDATION: Moderate sedation with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl administered by the bronchoscopy team. Topical 1% lidocaine applied to the oropharynx and vocal cords. The patient maintained spontaneous ventilation via native airway with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.\n\nPROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:\nAfter a time-out and confirmation of consent, a flexible adult bronchoscope was introduced orally with a bite block. The vocal cords were mobile and normal in appearance. The trachea and main carina were normal with mild extrinsic impression at the subcarinal region but no endobronchial tumor. The right and left bronchial trees were inspected to the subsegmental level without obstructing lesions.\n\nCONVENTIONAL TBNA (WANG NEEDLE):\nA 21-gauge Wang transbronchial aspiration needle was passed through the working channel. Using anatomic landmarks only (no EBUS or ultrasound), multiple passes were made through the bronchial wall just proximal to the main carina targeting the subcarinal (station 7) lymph node seen on imaging (short-axis 15 mm). Four needle passes were performed with suction applied on each pass, yielding blood-tinged material with visible tissue fragments.\n\nROSE: An on-site cytotechnologist was present. Rapid on-site evaluation showed abundant lymphocytes with clusters of malignant epithelial cells, consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Adequacy was confirmed after the third pass; a fourth pass was performed for cell block and ancillary studies.\n\nSPECIMENS:\nStation 7 conventional TBNA x4 passes, submitted for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry with reflex molecular studies if malignant.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: Minimal oozing at the puncture site resolved with suction and cold saline. No significant bleeding, hypoxia, or hemodynamic instability. No linear EBUS, radial EBUS, or navigational bronchoscopy was used at any point; this was a purely conventional blind Wang needle TBNA.\n\nDISPOSITION/PLAN:\nThe patient was monitored in the bronchoscopy recovery area and discharged home in stable condition. Final cytology, cell block, and molecular profiling from station 7 will be reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board. Further management (surgical resection versus chemoradiation or systemic therapy) will be based on complete staging results.", "meta": {"file": "golden_273.json", "suspected_leaks": "Titled Name"}}

Patient enrolled in IRB-approved protocol. Detailed explanation of traditional ablation alternatives (microwave, RFA, cryo). Patient elected to participate after reviewing consent documents and meeting with research coordinator.\n\nTECHNIQUE:\nGeneral anesthesia. ENB performed with illumiSite platform. Target: LUL apicoposterior segment. Radial EBUS confirmation of lesion. Novel PFA catheter (FarapulsePulm system, 3.0mm diameter, bipolar electrode configuration) advanced through extended working channel. IMPORTANT: PFA uses rapid electrical pulses (1000-2000 V/cm) to create irreversible electroporation of cell membranes WITHOUT thermal damage - fundamentally different mechanism than traditional ablation modalities.\n\nABLATION PARAMETERS:\n- Pulse duration: 100 microseconds\n- Number of pulses: 80 per cycle  \n- Pulse frequency: 1 Hz\n- Number of treatment cycles: 3\n- Inter-cycle pause: 30 seconds\n- Voltage: 1500 V (adjusted based on impedance 80-120 ohms)\n- Energy delivery: Non-thermal (avoids bronchial damage, theoretically preserves adjacent structures)\n\nINTRAPROCEDURAL MONITORING:\nAdvanced impedance mapping performed throughout treatment showing successful energy delivery to entire tumor volume. Real-time EBUS post-ablation showed immediate increased echogenicity within tumor - consistent with cellular disruption from electroporation. No thermal injury pattern noted on adjacent bronchial walls (major advantage of PFA technology).\n\nOUTCOMES: \nSuccessfully completed per protocol. No arrhythmias noted (ECG monitoring showed stable rhythm - PFA timed to occur outside cardiac vulnerable period). Patient hemodynamically stable. Airways intact, no hemorrhage.\n\nNOVEL FINDINGS: \nPFA appears to cause more homogeneous ablation zone compared to thermal modalities. Real-time elastography (investigational feature) suggested complete tumor necrosis immediately post-procedure.\n\nDISPOSITION: Research protocol follow-up including CT at 48 hours, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks with volumetric analysis.

Partial registration was used. Registration error: 1.9mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Medial Segment of RML (RB5). Target lesion is approximately 35mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.4cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Continuous margin noted.\n\nNeedle was advanced into the lesion. Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation. Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion). I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nUsing the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. Vision probe removed for biopsy; catheter position maintained via shape-sensing lock. Repeat imaging confirmed tool-in-lesion.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 5 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used.

{"text": "PATIENT NAME: Rodriguez, Maria G.\nMEDICAL RECORD NUMBER: 2025-IP-9847\nDATE OF BIRTH: 03/08/1955 (Age 70 years)\nPROCEDURE DATE: October 15, 2025\nINSTITUTION: Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Kevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nFELLOWS: Dr. Lisa Nguyen (PGY-6), Dr. Thomas Wright (PGY-5)\nANESTHESIA PROVIDER: Dr. Susan Mitchell, MD\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nLeft lower lobe pulmonary nodule, 2.6 cm, lateral basal segment, highly suspicious for primary lung cancer based on PET-avid characteristics (SUV 11.2) and growth on serial imaging (1.8 cm six months prior). Transbronchial biopsy via radial EBUS on 09/22/2025 yielded adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 positivity.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative\n\nOPERATION PERFORMED:\nFlexible bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation and cryoablation of left lower lobe peripheral pulmonary nodule\n\nCLINICAL SCENARIO:\nPatient is a 70-year-old woman with extensive medical comorbidities including severe emphysema (FEV1 32% predicted, DLCO 38% predicted), obesity (BMI 38), diabetes mellitus type 2 with complications including diabetic nephropathy (CKD stage 3b, baseline Cr 1.8), and history of pulmonary embolism on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated VO2 max of 11 mL/kg/min. Thoracic surgery evaluation concluded operative mortality risk >25% and declined surgical candidacy. Discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board with medical oncology, radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology. Given patient preference for minimally invasive approach and contraindications to SBRT (previous radiation to left chest for breast cancer), bronchoscopic ablation recommended as optimal treatment strategy.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nAfter obtaining informed consent and completing universal protocol time-out, patient brought to IP suite. Standard ASA monitors applied. Pre-procedure antibiotics NOT administered per institutional protocol for ablation procedures. \n\nGeneral anesthesia induced by anesthesiology team. Oral endotracheal intubation performed using 8.0 mm inner diameter tube with video laryngoscope assistance. Tube positioned at 21 cm at incisors. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. \n\nOlympus therapeutic videobronchoscope (BF-P290) introduced through endotracheal tube. Comprehensive inspection of airways performed and documented:\n- Normal supraglottic structures\n- Trachea: patent, no masses or compression, mild tracheomalacia\n- Carina: sharp, mobile\n- Right bronchial tree: normal segmental anatomy\n- Left bronchial tree: normal upper lobe segments; lower lobe segments patent, no endobronchial abnormalities visualized\n\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy commenced using Veran SPiN Planning and Navigation System. Pre-loaded CT scan from 10/05/2025 with 1mm slice thickness utilized for planning. Target lesion in left lower lobe lateral basal segment identified at 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Virtual bronchoscopy pathway created and navigation pathway optimized.\n\nRegistration performed using automated CT-to-body registration with 6 fiducial points. Registration error: 2.8mm (acceptable, <4mm threshold). \n\nSteerable guide sheath (8.0 Fr) with always-on tip tracking advanced through working channel. Navigation to target required approximately 15 minutes with multiple adjustments due to peripheral location and acute branching angles. Extended working channel passed through guide sheath.\n\nRadial EBUS probe (20 MHz) advanced through EWC. Multiple radial planes examined showing solid, hypoechoic mass in direct contact position with probe centered within lesion. Lesion characteristics: heterogeneous internal echogenicity, irregular borders, size 26 x 23 mm consistent with imaging and expected tumor characteristics.\n\nFluoroscopic confirmation performed showing guide sheath in appropriate peripheral location, approximately 3cm from pleural surface. Cone-beam CT would have been ideal but unavailable due to C-arm equipment malfunction (documented in safety report).\n\nCryoablation probe introduced (erbecryo 2 system, 2.4mm diameter probe with 3cm freeze zone). Probe advanced through EWC to center of lesion based on prior radial EBUS measurements. Due to technical considerations of lesion size >2.5cm, decision made to perform THREE freeze-thaw cycles rather than standard two cycles to ensure adequate margins:\n\nCycle 1: \n- Freeze time: 6 minutes\n- Temperature at probe tip: -165\u00b0C (monitor displayed continuous temperature throughout)\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes (until temperature >-20\u00b0C)\n\nCycle 2:\n- Freeze time: 6 minutes  \n- Temperature: -167\u00b0C\n- Passive thaw: 4 minutes\n\nCycle 3:\n- Freeze time: 5 minutes\n- Temperature: -163\u00b0C\n- Active thaw: 2 minutes using helium warming (to expedite procedure completion given >90 min elapsed time)\n\nThroughout ablation cycles, patient monitored closely. Vital signs stable: HR 68-78 bpm, BP 128-142/72-85 mmHg, SpO2 97-99% on FiO2 0.5. No arrhythmias noted on continuous ECG monitoring. Ice ball formation visualized fluoroscopically during freeze cycles with appropriate coverage of target region and safety margin.\n\nPost-ablation radial EBUS repeated showing marked hyperechoic changes throughout tumor volume consistent with ice crystal formation and cellular destruction. Ablation zone appeared to extend approximately 5mm beyond original tumor margins in all directions - adequate for oncologic treatment.\n\nCryoprobe removed slowly. Guide sheath withdrawn under direct visualization with sequential airway inspection. Findings:\n- Mild mucosal blanching at peripheral contact points (expected, transient)\n- No hemorrhage\n- No airway perforation\n- Small amount of blood-tinged secretions suctioned (<5 mL estimated)\n\nComplete re-examination of left bronchial tree performed post-procedure showing patent airways without evidence of significant edema or injury. \n\nBronchoscope withdrawn. Patient reversed from anesthesia per standard protocol. Extubation successful with adequate respiratory drive and airway protective reflexes. Transferred to PACU in stable condition with SpO2 95% on 3L nasal cannula.\n\nFINDINGS:\n1. Successful navigation to LLL lateral basal segment target\n2. Cryoablation performed per modified protocol (3 cycles for larger lesion)\n3. Adequate ablation zone achieved based on post-procedure EBUS\n4. No procedural complications\n\nSPECIMENS: None\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\n\nINTRAVENOUS FLUIDS: 850 mL lactated Ringer's solution\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None intraoperatively\n\nDRAINS/TUBES: None placed\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n1. Admit to Pulmonary PCU (4 West) for monitoring\n2. Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry\n3. Chest X-ray portable in 4 hours to evaluate for pneumothorax/complications\n4. CT chest with IV contrast at 24 hours for baseline post-ablation imaging\n5. Pain management: acetaminophen 1000mg PO q8h scheduled, oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4h PRN moderate pain, morphine 2-4mg IV q3h PRN severe pain\n6. Resume apixaban 24 hours post-procedure (held for 48 hours pre-procedure)\n7. Continue home medications including insulin regimen\n8. Incentive spirometry 10x/hour while awake\n9. Ambulation with assistance as tolerated\n10. Diet as tolerated\n11. DVT prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (no pharmacologic prophylaxis until anticoagulation resumed)\n\nFOLLOW-UP PLAN:\n- Anticipated discharge POD 1 if uncomplicated course\n- Clinic appointment in 1 week with chest X-ray\n- CT chest at 6 weeks for initial response assessment (expect central low attenuation with peripheral rim enhancement on post-ablation changes)\n- PET-CT at 3 months for metabolic response evaluation\n- Continued surveillance per NCCN guidelines with CT every 3-6 months for 2 years, then annually\n\nDISCUSSION WITH PATIENT/FAMILY:\nExtensive post-procedure discussion held with patient and daughter (healthcare proxy). Explained technical success of procedure, expected post-procedure course, and importance of close follow-up. Reviewed warning signs requiring immediate attention: severe chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, fever. Questions answered. Patient and family expressed understanding and satisfaction with care.\n\nTotal procedure time: 94 minutes\nFluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes  \nRadiation dose: 287 mGy-cm\u00b2\n\nATTESTATION: I was present for and personally performed the key components of this procedure including navigation, targeting, ablation, and post-procedure assessment.\n\n___________________________________________\nKevin Zhang, MD, FCCP, DABIP\nAssociate Professor of Medicine\nDirector of Advanced Bronchoscopy Fellowship\nDivision of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine\nStanford University School of Medicine\n\nCo-signed by:\nLisa Nguyen, MD (Pulmonary/Critical Care Fellow, PGY-6)\n\nProcedure dictated: 10/15/2025 16:45\nTranscribed: 10/15/2025 17:20\nElectronically authenticated: 10/15/2025 18:05", "meta": {"file": "golden_212.json", "suspected_leaks": "Unredacted Year, Titled Name"}}
{"text": "OPERATIVE REPORT - DETAILED NARRATIVE\nPART 1: AIRWAY INTERVENTION (07:45 - 10:15)\nPatient brought to hybrid OR suite. After successful induction of general anesthesia, formal time-out performed with all team members present. Confirmed:\n\nCorrect patient (ID band, verbal confirmation)\nProcedures planned (airway intervention, pericardial window, pleural catheter)\nPositioning (supine throughout)\nAntibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazolin 2g IV given)\nSteroid coverage (Dexamethasone 10mg IV given)\nBlood products available (2 units PRBCs typed and crossed)\n\nInitial orotracheal intubation performed by anesthesia with video laryngoscopy - 8.0mm ETT placed without difficulty. Position confirmed at 21cm at teeth with end-tidal CO2 and bilateral breath sounds. However, significantly diminished breath sounds on right side noted.\nInitial Flexible Bronchoscopy Survey:\nOlympus BF-1T180 therapeutic bronchoscope introduced through ETT. Findings:\n\nSupraglottic structures: Normal, no lesions\nVocal cords: Mobile bilaterally, no masses\nSubglottis: Normal caliber, no stenosis\nTrachea: Patent, mild mucosal erythema, no significant secretions\nCarina: Widened, evidence of external compression from adenopathy\nLeft main bronchus: Patent, some extrinsic compression but adequate luminal diameter\nLUL, Lingula, LLL: All segments visualized and patent\nRight main bronchus: CRITICAL FINDING - Near-complete obstruction beginning 1cm from carina. Large fungating tumor mass arising from anterior and lateral walls, extending 4cm distally. Approximately 90% obstruction. Friable, hemorrhagic appearance. Unable to pass bronchoscope beyond lesion. No visualization of RUL, RML, or RLL orifices.\n\nDecision: Proceed with rigid bronchoscopy for tumor debridement and airway restoration.\nRigid Bronchoscopy Phase:\nPatient re-positioned with shoulder roll for neck extension. The 8.0mm ETT was removed. A Storz 13mm rigid bronchoscope (Model #8580C) was carefully introduced through the oral cavity under direct visualization using Weerda laryngoscope.\nVentilation strategy: High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) via rigid scope side arm. Ventilator settings: Frequency 150/min, Driving pressure 2.0 bar, FiO2 1.0, I:E ratio 1:1.5. Good chest rise and end-tidal CO2 waveform confirmed adequate ventilation.\nThe rigid scope was advanced through the vocal cords under direct visualization. The trachea was traversed without difficulty. The tumor mass in right mainstem bronchus was encountered.\nMechanical Debridement:\nUsing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope as a core, the tumor was mechanically debrided with careful forward pressure and rotating motion. Multiple passes were required. Tumor tissue was extremely friable with significant bleeding encountered.\nEstimated tumor volume removed via coring: Approximately 20-25 cubic centimeters of tumor tissue\nHemostasis Measures:\nAs expected, bleeding was brisk during debulking. The following measures were employed:\n\nIced saline lavage: 500mL total of iced normal saline instilled in 50-100mL aliquots, allowed to dwell 30-60 seconds, then suctioned. This provided temporary hemostasis.\nTopical epinephrine: 1:10,000 concentration, total 30mL instilled in divided doses to tumor bed. Significant reduction in bleeding achieved.\nTranexamic acid: 1 gram in 100mL NS instilled topically (in addition to 1g IV given by anesthesia systemically). Further improvement in hemostasis.\n\nAfter approximately 30 minutes of mechanical debridement and hemostatic measures, adequate visualization of distal airways was achieved. The RUL, RML, and RLL orifices could be visualized, though tumor bulk remained on the airway walls.\nElectrocautery:\nFlexible bronchoscope (Olympus) passed through rigid barrel. Electrocautery probe advanced through working channel. Residual tumor tissue was cauterized using monopolar cautery at 40 watts in coagulation mode. FiO2 was reduced to 0.4 during cautery per safety protocol.\nTreatment areas: Anterior wall, lateral wall, and carina region of right mainstem bronchus\nTreatment time: Approximately 8 minutes total cautery time\nEffect: Tumor base cauterized, some reduction in tumor bulk, improved hemostasis\nArgon Plasma Coagulation:\nAPC probe (ERBE VIO system) advanced through flexible scope. Settings: 40 watts, Argon flow 1.5 L/min, Pulsed mode.\nTreatment: Circumferential APC application to all visible tumor tissue in right mainstem bronchus. Particular attention to areas of residual bleeding.\nDuration: 6 minutes active APC time\nResult: Excellent hemostasis achieved, visible coagulation effect on tumor surface\nAssessment after debridement:\nRight mainstem bronchus now approximately 50% patent (improved from <10% pre-treatment). However, significant residual tumor bulk and malacia noted.\nBalloon Dilation:\nBoston Scientific CRE balloon catheter (12mm x 4cm) advanced over guidewire to stenotic segment under fluoroscopic guidance.\nInflation sequence:\n\nFirst inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nSecond inflation: 12mm diameter x 60 seconds\nThird inflation: 14mm diameter x 90 seconds (maximum size)\n\nFluoroscopy showed excellent balloon expansion across entire stenotic segment. Upon deflation, improved luminal diameter appreciated.\nPost-dilation assessment: Right mainstem bronchus now approximately 60-65% patent. However, given residual tumor bulk, malacia, and risk of rapid re-obstruction, decision made to place stent.\nStent Placement:\nAfter discussion with anesthesia regarding patient stability (patient remained stable throughout), proceeded with metallic stent placement.\nStent selected: Boston Scientific Ultraflex covered metallic stent, 14mm diameter x 60mm length\nDeployment technique:\n\nStent advanced over guidewire under combined bronchoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance\nPositioned to span from 0.5cm distal to carina to mid-right mainstem bronchus\nFluoroscopic confirmation of position in AP and lateral views\nSlow, controlled deployment under direct visualization\nPost-deployment balloon dilation of stent (12mm balloon) to ensure full stent expansion\n\nPost-stent assessment:\nFlexible bronchoscope passed through rigid scope and into stent lumen.\nFindings:\n\nStent well-positioned, no migration\nExcellent apposition to airway walls\nRUL orifice: Fully visible through stent side mesh, patent\nRML orifice: Visible and patent\nRLL orifice: Visible and patent\nAll segments of right lung now visualized for first time\nSignificant amount of retained secretions in distal airways (expected due to chronic obstruction)\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration:\nExtensive suctioning and aspiration performed in all segments of right lung. Thick, purulent-appearing secretions removed from:\n\nRight upper lobe: Approximately 30mL\nRight middle lobe: Approximately 20mL\nRight lower lobe: Approximately 40mL\n\nTotal secretions removed: ~90mL. Samples sent for culture.\nFinal Airway Inspection:\n\nTrachea: Normal\nLeft bronchial tree: Unchanged, patent\nRight main stem: Patent through stent, estimated 85-90% luminal patency (compared to pre-procedure ~10%)\nRUL, RML, RLL: All now patent with significant improvement in ventilation\nMinimal residual bleeding, hemostasis excellent\n\nRigid bronchoscope removed. Patient re-intubated with 8.0mm ETT. Confirmation of ETT position with bronchoscopy and capnography. Bilateral breath sounds now audible (marked improvement in right-sided ventilation compared to pre-procedure).\nAirway Intervention Completed: 10:15 AM\nEstimated blood loss during airway phase: 200mL\nSpecimens obtained: Tumor tissue (pathology), secretions (microbiology)\n\nPART 2: PERICARDIAL WINDOW (10:30 - 11:15)\nPatient repositioned with arms tucked. Subxiphoid area prepped and draped in sterile fashion by cardiothoracic surgery team. Interventional pulmonology team assisted.\nTEE probe inserted by anesthesia showed moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with RV diastolic collapse.\nSurgical technique (performed by CT surgery, Dr. Harrison):\n\nSubxiphoid incision, approximately 4cm\nDissection carried down to pericardium\nPericardium opened, approximately 4cm x 3cm window created\nRush of 400mL of serosanguineous fluid\nPericardial biopsy obtained (sent for pathology and cytology)\nNo active bleeding from pericardial surface\n19Fr Blake drain left in pericardial space\nDrain secured to skin, connected to bulb suction\n\nTEE post-drainage: Complete resolution of pericardial effusion, no RV collapse, improved cardiac output.\n\nPART 3: PLEURAL CATHETER PLACEMENT (11:20 - 11:45)\nWith patient still under general anesthesia, attention turned to right pleural effusion.\nUltrasound examination (performed by IP team):\n\nRight hemithorax with moderate-large pleural effusion\nEstimated volume: 1000-1200mL\nAnechoic fluid, no loculations\nCompressed right lung (though now ventilating via stent)\n\nPleurX catheter placement:\nStandard tunneled technique as previously described. Entry site: 6th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Exit site: 5cm anterior. Catheter advanced 15cm into pleural space.\nInitial drainage: 850mL of serosanguineous fluid removed (stopped at patient request earlier - she was waking up and uncomfortable).\nChest tube secured with 2-0 nylon sutures.

Patient indicated a wish to proceed and informed consent was signed.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent malignant pleural effusion, right\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nPROCEDURE: Indwelling Tunneled Pleural Catheter Placement (CPT 32550)\nATTENDING: Dr. Rachel Green\nASSISTANT: Dr. Paul Anderson, Fellow\nSupport Staff:\n\nRN: Jennifer Martinez\nRT: David Lee\n\nANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia with Lidocaine 1%\nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, blood pressure\nINSTRUMENT: CareFusion PleurX catheter system, ultrasound machine\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nAfter timeout, all procedure related images were saved and archived.\nPATIENT POSITION: Sitting upright at 60 degrees, right arm elevated\nCHEST ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: (Image saved and printed)\n\nHemithorax: Right\nPleural Effusion Volume: Large\nEchogenicity: Anechoic\nLoculations: None\nDiaphragmatic Motion: Diminished\nLung sliding before procedure: Present\nLung consolidation/atelectasis: Present (compressive atelectasis)\nPleura: Mildly thickened, no nodularity visualized\n\nThe right lateral chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasound guidance was used to identify the optimal insertion site and confirm absence of vital structures.\nANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1%: 20ml injected at skin, subcutaneous tissue, pleura, and tunnel tract\nEntry Site: Right 5th Intercostal Space\nLocation: Mid-axillary line\nProcedure Steps:\n\nA finder needle (18G) was used to enter the pleural space in the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line under ultrasound guidance. Pleural fluid was easily aspirated (straw-colored fluid). The needle was withdrawn and a 0.038\" guidewire was placed into the pleural space through the finder catheter.\nTwo 5mm skin incisions were made: one at the guidewire entry site and another 5-6cm away anteriorly for the catheter exit site.\nThe tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue from the exit site to the pleural entry site. Tunnel length: 6cm.\nSerial dilation over the guidewire was achieved using 10Fr and 15Fr dilators. The peel-away introducer sheath (16Fr) was placed over the guidewire and advanced into the pleural space.\nThe guidewire was removed. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the introducer sheath into the pleural space until all fenestrations were within the pleural cavity (approximately 15cm inserted).\nThe introducer sheath was peeled away and removed. The pleural entry site incision was closed with a 3-0 absorbable suture (Vicryl).\nThe catheter cuff was positioned in the subcutaneous tunnel approximately 1cm from the exit site. The catheter was secured to the skin at the exit site using 2-0 nylon sutures.\nSterile dressings were applied (foam and transparent dressing).\n\nExit site: 5th Intercostal space, anterior axillary line\nInitial Drainage:\nThe PleurX vacuum bottle was attached and drainage initiated.\n\nFluid Removed: 1200 mL\nAppearance: Serous, straw-colored\n\nPleural Pressures Measured:\n\nOpening: -8 cmH\u2082O\n500ml: -10 cmH\u2082O\n1000ml: -15 cmH\u2082O\n1200ml: -18 cmH\u2082O (stopped due to chest discomfort)\n\nDrainage device: Initially vacuum bottle, then capped after drainage complete\nSPECIMEN(S):\n\nPleural fluid (cytology, chemistry, cell count)\n\nPost-procedure ultrasound showed reduced effusion volume with no pneumothorax. Post-procedure CXR ordered.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with only mild discomfort during catheter insertion. The attending, Dr. Green, was present throughout the entire procedure.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Ms. Johnson underwent successful placement of right-sided tunneled pleural catheter for recurrent malignant effusion. Procedure completed without complications. Patient and family educated on catheter care and home drainage protocol. Drainage every other day initially, adjusting based on output. Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Home health nursing arranged for first drainage. Patient given written discharge instructions and emergency contact information.", "meta": {"file": "golden_227.json", "suspected_leaks": "Titled Name"}}

An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPRVC\t13\t356\t10\t80\t5\t21\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 3.7mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the RML. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (RB5) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Medial Segment of RML.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 7 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage performed at RB5. 60mL NS instilled with 24mL return. Sent for Cell count, Culture, and Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Suspicious for non-small cell carcinoma\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nWilliams, MD", "meta": {"file": "golden_290.json", "suspected_leaks": "Titled Name"}}

{"text": "Pt: Wilson, Edward || MRN: 2386614 || DOB: 7/1/1972\nDate: 08/08/2025 || Location: UCSF Medical Center, San Francisco, CA\nAttending: CAPT Russell Miller, MD\n\nIndication: Peripheral pulmonary nodule\nTarget: 14mm nodule in LUL\n\nPROCEDURE:\n\nAfter the successful induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, procedure, and laterality. An 8.0 ETT was secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nThe visualized trachea is of normal caliber with sharp carina. Airways examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally. No endobronchial lesions identified. Mild secretions cleared with suction.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t13\t354\t18\t100\t5\t17\n\nThe patient was positioned on the bed within the electromagnetic field. Reference sensors were placed on the anterior chest wall. The Monarch robotic endoscope was introduced through the ETT.\n\nElectromagnetic registration was completed by correlating the live bronchoscopic view with the virtual airway model at multiple anatomic landmarks including the main carina, right and left mainstem bronchi, and lobar carinas. Registration accuracy confirmed with error of 4.6mm.\n\nThe device was navigated to the LUL. The outer sheath was parked and locked at the ostium of the segmental airway (LB1+2) to provide stability. The inner scope was then telescoped distally into the sub-segmental airways to reach the target lesion in the Apicoposterior Segment of LUL.\n\nRadial EBUS performed via the working channel. rEBUS view: Adjacent. Lesion confirmed at target location.\n\nCrucially, continuous visualization was maintained throughout sampling. The needle was advanced through the working channel, and needle exit from the scope tip was visually confirmed before entering the bronchial wall.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 21G aspiration needle under direct endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. 6 passes performed. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed with standard forceps through the working channel. 6 specimens obtained. Continuous visualization maintained during each pass. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nProtected cytology brushings obtained under direct visualization. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: No evidence of malignant neoplasm\n\nThe inner scope was retracted into the outer sheath. Final airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or airway trauma. The robotic system was removed.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery area, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results in 5-7 days.\n\nMiller, MD", "meta": {"file": "golden_289.json", "suspected_leaks": "Unredacted Year, Unredacted Date"}}
