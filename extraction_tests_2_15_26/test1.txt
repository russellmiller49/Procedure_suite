ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
VCV	15	350	12	100	10	15
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).  Target lesion is about 2 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin  and Absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 4 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Cytology.
 
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.1mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter.  Freeze time of 6 seconds were used.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 10 cc of NS, suction returned with 5 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
 
ROSE from ION procedure was noted to be:
Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm
 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
 
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
 
Second RLL target was attempted with the following settings. 
 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	15	350	16	100	10	20
 
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Lateral-basal Segment of RLL (RB9).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is not visible.  T
 
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
 
2 spins were done to assess the area and the RLL nodule was not identified on the system.  Due to inability to identify the nodule, we aborted the procedure. 
 
 
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
 
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 22-gauge Needle.
 
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
10R lymph node
10L lymph node
11Rs lymph node
11L lymph node
 
No immediate complications
 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
Site 3: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_021 SOURCE_FILE: note_021.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 68 year old-year-old male who presents with persistent airleak.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J93.82 Other airleaks
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J93.82 Other airleaks
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance 
31635 Foreign body removal
31647 Bronchial valve insert initial lobe 
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)  31624 BAL done in multiple lobes. 
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Flexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus and mucus plug. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral-basal Segment of RLL (RB9).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Serial occlusion with endobronchial blocker (ardnts 7Fr) and Fogarty balloon was done to isolate the airleak to be at the RLL (Lateral and Posterior subsegment).  Airleak was reproduced with inspiratory hold at 30 and suction on pleurovac on -20cmH20. 
 
Tisseel 2cc was used to block off a subsegment of the RLL posterior branch.  
 
Size 7 spiration valve was placed but noted to be too large for the airway (RB10).  This was subsequently removed. 
 
Then Size 6 spiration valve was placed in RB9, in good position. 
Then size 6 spiration valve was placed in RB10, noted to be in poor position, this was removed again and replaced with another size 6 spiration valve in a better angle. 
 
Final: 
RB9 - size 6 spiration valve
RB10- size 6 spiration valve
 
With airleak significantly decreased.  
 
See Dr. Thistlethwaite's note for VATS and pleurodesis. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
BAL (x2) 
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 68 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for BAL and valve placement. 
- f/u in BAL results
- f/u in 6 weeks for valve removal

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_187 SOURCE_FILE: note_187.txt Procedure Name: EBUS bronchoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage
Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy and interstitial lung disease 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically enlarged station 7, 4R and 11Rs lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the station 4R lymph node, followed by the station 7 lymph node and finally the 4L lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as benign lymphoid tissue in all sampled nodes. All samples were sent for routine cytology and flow cytometry. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. Using fluoroscopy transbronchial forceps lung biopsies were performed in both the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. Finally BAL was performed with 120cc instillation and 40cc return. Prior to removing the bronchoscope an airway examination was performed and no evidence of active bleeding was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful EBUS bronchoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage 
- Will await final pathology and culture results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_232 SOURCE_FILE: note_232.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer with tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant mixed intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy
INDICATIONS: Tumor obstruction of bronchus intermedius  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following induction and paralyitic administration by anesthesia a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. On initial bronchoscopic inspection the trachea, left lung and right upper lobe appeared normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. Just distal to the right upper lobe orifice in the bronchus intermedius there was extensive endobronchial tumor causing complete airway obstruction.  At this point the flexible forceps were used to take tissue samples for pathological evaluation and tumor markers.  We then began to slowly debulk the endobronchial tumor through the use of a combination of APC, cryotherapy and forceps. A small opening was identified leading to the right lower lobe bronchus and an ultrathin bronchospe was advanced through the opening and purulent material was expressed from the distal airways from related to post-obstructive pneumonia. We were able to visualize the secondary carina’s within the right lower lobe (basilar segments) with the exception of the superior segment which could not be identified as well and the right middle lobe. We continued to debulk the tumor and utilizing an 8-9-10 CRE balloon were able to achieve approximately 90% recanalization of the broncus intermedius and the proximal right lower lobe orifice however there was extensive tumor infiltration deep into all of the right lower lobe segments. The right middle lobe orifice was encased with extensive tumor and we could only achieve about 15% recanalization. Infiltrating friable areas of tumor were painted with argon plasma coagulation for hemostasis. Due to the extent of tumor within the distal airways we did not believe that airway stent placement would be appropriate as distal tumor ingrowth would likely occur.  Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Await tissue diagnosis for confirmation of recurrence and molecular studies.
We expect the obstruction to recur due to the extent of tumor involvement. Will discuss with patients primary oncologist regarding options for systemic therapy.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_205 SOURCE_FILE: note_205.txt Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.

Following intravenous medications and intubation by anesthesia, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the ETT and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. At the carina for the superior segment of the left lower lobe was a mucosal irregularity concerning for endobronchial tumor. Otherwise bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal without other endobronchial lesions. Enbobronchial forcep biopsies were performed of the superior segment lesion with minimal bleeding. The Covidien superDimension locatable guide was then inserted through the working channel and registration was performed. The Edge 180 degree extended working channel was then attached to the bronchoscope.  Using navigational map we attempted to advance into the proximity of the lesion within the left lower lobe lesion. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with peripheral needle with on ROSE were non-diagnostic. Due to intermittent hypoxia and rising peak pressures decision was made to abort peripheral biopsies and BAL of the anterior segment of the left lower lobe was performed with 90cc instillation and 25cc return.  Repeat fluoroscopic imaging showed large left sided pneumothorax. 
The left axillary area was the prepped in a sterile fashion. A Yueh centesis needle was advanced into the pleural space. Air was easily aspirated and the catheter was advanced into the space and needle withdrawn. A guidewire was inserted through the catheter. A small skin incision was made at the wire site and a two-step dilatation of pleural tract was then performed via Seldinger technique. The Cooke 12F pigtail catheter was then inserted with its trocar in place over the wire. The trocar was subsequently removed with the wire. The catheter was subsequently connected to the pleurovac and the catheter sutured into place. Repeat fluoroscopic imaging showed pig tail in place and complete lung re-expansion. The patient was subsequently intubated and admitted to the IM service for chest tube management. 

Recommendations:
1.	Admit to IM service for CT management
2.	Await pathology and microbiological assessment from biopsy specimens and lavage
3.	We will follow on the inpatinet service and provide further recs regarding CT management.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report
Score: 72 / 100
Status: ⚠️ WARNING

While the extraction pipeline successfully captures the breadth of complex procedures and utilizes the V3 schema effectively, there are critical precision errors across the batch. The system struggles with aborted targets, misattributing sample counts, and misclassifying instilled fluids, which directly leads to erroneous downstream CPT coding (upcoding).

Here is the detailed audit of the batch test results:

1. Accuracy (Precision)

Hallucinations (Aborted Targets treated as Performed): In note_047, the JSON indicates that Brushings, Peripheral TBNA, and Transbronchial Cryobiopsies were performed in the Right Lower Lobe (RLL / RB9). However, the text explicitly states the RLL target was attempted, but "Due to inability to identify the nodule, we aborted the procedure.". The pipeline hallucinated planned targets as performed interventions.
+2


Hallucinations (Inspected Nodes treated as Sampled): In note_187, the JSON logs node 11R as aspirated. The text states the physician "utilized [Ultrasound] to identify and measure... 7, 4R and 11Rs lymph nodes" but specifically notes sampling was "performed beginning with the station 4R... followed by the station 7... and finally the 4L". Node 11Rs was measured, not sampled.
+2


Mismatch (Sample Counts): In note_047, the JSON reports number_of_samples: 4 for the Transbronchial Biopsy (forceps). The text explicitly states "Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps... Total 1 samples were collected". The pipeline incorrectly grabbed the sample count from the preceding TBNA section.
+2

2. Completeness (Recall)

Missed Details (Fluid Misclassification): In note_187, the text states "BAL was performed with 120cc instillation and 40cc return.". The JSON completely misses the volume_instilled_ml for the BAL object.
+1


Missed Procedures (Misinterpreted as separate procedure): In note_187, because the pipeline missed the 120cc BAL instillation, it hallucinated a therapeutic_injection object with volume_ml: 120.0.

3. Logic & Coding

CPT Consistency (Critical Billing Risk): * note_047: Because the pipeline hallucinated procedures in the aborted RLL, it generated CPT codes 31632 (TBBX add'l lobe) and 31633 (TBNA add'l lobe). Billing for lobes that were aborted is a critical compliance failure.
+3


note_187: Because the pipeline misclassified the BAL instillation as a therapeutic injection, it incorrectly suggested CPT 31573 (Therapeutic injection).
+1

Schema Compliance: The schema compliance is generally strong, cleanly mapping complex V3 node events and bleeding Nashville grades. However, the audit_warnings in note_047 show a backfill warning: "BACKFILL: Assigned target '['LUL', 'LB3']' to brushings.locations". This indicates the deterministic logic is forcing values that the LLM missed, which may be contributing to the anatomic overlap errors.

4. Corrected JSON Snippet
Correction for note_047 procedures_performed (removing the aborted RLL target and fixing the forceps sample count):
