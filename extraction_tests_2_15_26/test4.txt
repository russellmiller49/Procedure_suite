NOTE_ID:  note_087 SOURCE_FILE: note_087.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Pt with transplant stenosis that required 4 balloon dilations and 6 applications of cryo . This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: supine
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appear normal. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for stenosis of the RML (75% patent). Diameter was 5-6 mm
Moderate clear secretions bilaterally, white thicker mucus eminating from RML. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
Endobronchial obstruction at RML was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7mm probe	 	30sec freeze-thaw cycles; total 6 applications	Ablation
 
Balloon dilation was performed at RML.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML.  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 75% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was successfully extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID:  note_091 SOURCE_FILE: note_091.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31630 Balloon dilation
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for mildly tortuous airways as before, intact anastomoses bilaterally. The RML orifice was ~75% narrowed with combination of weblike stenosis and pedunculated granulation tissue. Mild secretions bilaterally but with thick purulent secretions eminating from the RML. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Bronchus Intermedius  and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RML.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
Balloon dilation was performed at RML.  Mustang 4mm balloon was used to perform dilation to 4 mm at the RML.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Balloon dilation was performed at RML.  Mustang 6/7/8 balloon was used to perform dilation to 6 and 7 mm at the RML.  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at RML.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Endobronchial obstruction at RML was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7mm probe	 	30sec freeze thaw cycles	Ablation 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 25% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- RML EBBx (micro)
- RML BAL
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial stenosis of the RML. Ongoing recurrence of stenosis, currently on stent holiday. Will need ongoing close vigilance of the airway due to tendency to fuse shut. 
- f/u BAL results
- repeat bronch in 2 weeks for dilation

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_100 SOURCE_FILE: note_100.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure. 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
ANESTHESIA: 
Local ONLY
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Lidocaine applied to trachea, main carina, RMS, & LMS.
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for persistent pale plaque of tissue along the anterior wall of the RMSB/BI and RML orifice.   The previously seen metallic hemoclip near the RMS anastomosis posterior membrane is no longer present.  The RML orifice is now completely stenosed by overlying necrotic debris.  Unable to probe into the airway to achieve patency. The LMSB anastomosis shows mild granulation tissue and similar pale soft tissue plaque along the anterior aspect of the distal LMSB. Segmental airways on the left are widely patent. Clear secretions bilaterally. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, and RLL and LLL from mucus. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure and bronchial anastomotic dehiscence and stenosis. 
-Plan for bronchoscopy under GA for mngmnt of RML stenosis - likely excision of overlying debris, balloon dilation, and stent placement.  Likely on [REDACTED].

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_245 SOURCE_FILE: note_245.txt Procedure Name: Pleuroscopy
Indications: Pleural effusion
Medications: Fentanyl 3, versed 75, Lidocaine 30cc 1%
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the L lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 800cc of dark bloody fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. There were multiple thick adhesions and areas of lung tethering to the posterior chest wall. We were unable to identify the diaphragm or apex due to fused lung that would have required extensive lysis to pass. There was extensive inflammation in the adhered lung which we could peel away relatively easily in the thinner areas to expose parietal pleura which was generally normal appearing.  The 5mm port could not fit the optical forceps and we then exchanged the it for a disposable 8mm trochar. Biopsies of the parietal pleura posteriorly as well as areas of non-ventilated fused lung adherent to the pleural (non-functional appearing) were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination and culture with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was no significant bleeding. The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly. 

PleurX Catheter Placement:

A guide wire was inserted into the site of pleuroscopy entry and the port was removed. A separate skin site was identified ~5cm inferior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <1cm incision was then performed. A subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.  The Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract. A 16 fr peel away sheath was inserted over the wire via seldinger technique. The PleurX catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath. Both incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed. The catheter was subsequently connected to the drainage wall suction and minimal serosanguinous fluid was drained.  The patient’s wife was then brought into the room for drainage draining and a PleurX bottle was attached to the catheter and approximate 75cc of bloody fluid was obtained. The catheter tip was then capped and the PleurX was dressed and covered with a translucent dressing. 

The patient tolerated the procedural well.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed pleural catheter in place.
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 75cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion 
Recommendation:
Will await pathology and microbiological studies
Patient education on pleural catheter draining performed and patient and wife will return to clinic if needed for more training.

PROCEDURE FINDINGS: 
A  pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.  The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered.

🩺 Extraction Quality Report
Score: 88 / 100
Status: ⚠️ WARNING

Based on a rigorous audit of the Unified Pipeline Batch Test Results (5 notes), the extraction engine is performing very well overall, correctly navigating complex NCCI bundling rules and extracting granular findings. However, there are two notable NLP/logic failures resulting in clinical hallucinations and incorrect CPT derivation that require immediate tuning.

1. Accuracy (Precision)

Hallucination (Note 091): The JSON hallucinated procedures_performed.mechanical_debulking: { performed: true }. The text states, "Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RML. Lesion was successfully removed". The pipeline conflated forceps biopsy removal with "mechanical debulking."
+2


Hallucination (Note 041): The JSON hallucinated pleural_procedures.chest_tube_removal: { performed: true }. The text explicitly states the tube was "secured in place with suture". The NLP erroneously triggered on procedural steps like "introducer needle was then removed" and "dilator was removed".
+3


Mismatch (Note 091): The JSON mapped balloon_diameter_mm: 4.0. While a 4mm balloon was used , the note also clearly documents a subsequent dilation: "Mustang 6/7/8 balloon was used to perform dilation to 6 and 7 mm".
+2

2. Completeness (Recall)

Missed Details (Note 091): As noted above, the pipeline missed the maximum dilation diameter (7mm) , capturing only the initial 4mm dilation.
+1


Missed Details (Note 087): The text specifies a "6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm". The JSON captured the method as "Balloon"  but failed to extract the 8.0mm diameter entirely.
+1

3. Logic & Coding

CPT Cascade Failure (Note 091): The hallucinated mechanical_debulking  caused a severe coding error. The engine derived 31640 (Excision) and subsequently dropped 31641 (Destruction) due to the excision_with_destruction bundling rule. The clinical reality is that only a biopsy (31625) and Cryoprobe ablation (31641) were performed.
+4

Rule Execution Success (Note 245): The engine successfully executed the QA guardrail for moderate sedation. It identified the sedation drugs but accurately dropped codes 99152/99153 because the anesthesia_provider was missing from the documentation.

Rule Execution Success (Note 087 & 100): CPT derivation was flawless. Diagnostic bronchoscopy (31622) was correctly bundled into surgical codes , and dilation (31630) was correctly bundled into the destruction code (31641).
+2
