NOTE_ID:  note_062 SOURCE_FILE: note_062.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 68 year old-year-old male who presents with lung transplant and airway stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required conversion to rigid bronchoscopy and stent removal and re-placement . This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus
31635 Foreign body removal. 
 
31630 - completed in the right mainstem bronchus
31636 performed in the left main stem bronchus 
This increase the time and complexity of the procedure
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Rigid Bronchoscope
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Normal.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Slight stenosis as anastamosis site without evidence of dehiscence. Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Stent in place at LMSB. Thick mucus throughout. Granulation at distal stent and evidence of distal stent migration and occlusion of LUL. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Granulation tissue at distal LMSB stent. Slightly friable.
Secretions: Copious thick and thin secretions throughout with left greater than right.
 
MUCUS WITHIN TRACHEA AT OUTSET OF PROCEDURE
 
 
DISTAL LMSB STENT WITH GRANULATION TISSUE AND DISTAL MIGRATION
 
 
RMSB STENOSIS AT ANASTOMOSIS SITE
 
  
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8).  Instilled 80 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Given evidence of distal migration of the stent and occlusion of the left upper lobe, decision was made to remove the patient's stent and place a larger stent.
 
After induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline while keeping the alignment with the axis of the trachea and minimizing pressure to the teeth. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully while minimizing contact with them. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. 
 
The rigid bronchoscope was placed in the left mainstem bronchus and the patient's stent was grasped with the single-action rigid forceps. The stent was removed from the patient's airway through the rigid bronchoscope (foreign body removal).
 
The following stent (Bonastent, 12 x 50mm, covered) was placed in the Left Mainstem. 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Left Mainstem through the stent to fully expand seat the stent.  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Left Mainstem.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 10 seconds each.
 
VIEW OF NEW LMSB STENT
 
 
Balloon dilation was performed at Right Mainstem (at stenotic anastamosis site).  10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the Right Mainstem.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
VIEW OF RMSB STENOSIS AT ANASTOMOSIS (AFTER BALLOON DILATION) 
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--LLL BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
--LMSB stent (path)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 68 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway stenosis and stent evaluation. Patient underwent stent removal and re-placement without immediate complication.
 
--Continue stent hydration regimen TID in the following order: 
1) Albuterol nebs
2) Hypertonic saline (3%) nebs

NOTE_ID:  note_260 SOURCE_FILE: note_260.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant lung mass with left lower lobe and partial left main-stem obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant airway obstruction 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with airway debulking
INDICATIONS: left mainstem obstruction 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  The proximal and mid left mainstem were normal. In the distal left mainstem a white fungating tumor was seen causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and extending from the left lower lobe bronchus to causing complete obstruction of the lingula and 80% obstruction of the left mainstem.  The LMA was then removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then utilized cryoextraction to remove large pieces of tumor piece meal. Most of the superficial tumor was avascular and did not bleed but as we continued debulking into less necrotic tumor mild bleeding occurred and was treated with cold saline flushes. After extensive debulking we were able to advance the bronchoscope into the lingula were some purulent secretions were seen and performed mini BAL. The tumor however extended into the subsegments of the lingula and deemed likely not salvageable with endobronchial treatment alone.  APC was then used to coagulate the residual superficial layer of oozing tumor. At the end of the procedure distal left mainstem was only 15% obstructed. The left upper lobe proper (anterior and apical posterior segments) were completely patent. The lingula was 80% obstructed and the left lower lobe remained completely obstructed with distal tumor. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 
Recommendations:
Transfer to PACU and then home once discharge criteria met. 
Will discuss with oncology if biopsy samples obtained during procedure need any specific mutational analysis. 
Defer to oncology regarding medical and radiation treatment. 
Will monitor for symptoms or radiographic signs of tumor regrowth and possible need for repeat debulking to salvage left upper lobe.

From her Lt MCA CVA has Rt hemiplegia 
 
In need of tracheostomy to assist with ventilator weaning, secretion management, and ongoing potential rehabilitation. Primary team, ICU team, and family in agreement. Ventilator settings, labs, and body habitus adequate for bedside procedure. Has slightly high riding innominate artery (though not classic) as well as a large bridging neck vein. VV ECMO/DVT/PE anticoagulation held and will restart shortly thereafter. Consent signed.
 
Details of Procedure Performed:  
 
The patient remained in the ICU with a previously placed single-lumen endotracheal tube. The patient was positioned supine with a padded shoulder roll in place, the head of bed elevated, and the neck moderately extended. A surgical brief was performed and the level of inspired fraction of oxygen was reduced to 40%. Patient remained on VV ECMO support. After adequate anesthesia, landmarks were palpated including the thyroid notch, cricoid, and suprasternal notch. Neck ultrasound was performed to confirm vascular anatomy. Exposure was excellent. The anterior neck was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. 
 
A surgical time out was performed. 5mL of 1% lidocaine was injected 2-3 cm above the sternal notch. It was made higher due to the known partially high-riding innominate. A 3cm horizontal skin incision was made with a #15 blade knife in a natural, relaxed skin tension line midway between the cricoid cartilage and the sternal notch. Bovie cautery was used to dissect through the platysma and down to the strap muscles, with effort made to avoid the anterior jugular veins. There were two vertical engorged veins along the midline raphe with a bridging vein between then. The bridging vein was dissected, suture ligated, and divided. This allowed visualization of the midline raphe. The strap muscles were separated vertically at the midline with Bovie cautery. The strap muscles are retracted laterally. Using a combination of blunt and careful cautery midline dissection, the anterior tracheal wall was freed of soft tissue. The innominate artery was identified and protected. There was good soft tissue between the innominate and the trachea which was not disturbed.  The trachea was palpated to find the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings. There was adequate distance between the innominate artery and the planned insertion site. 
 
Under bronchoscopic guidance, the endotracheal tube cuff was deflated and was pulled back below the level of the vocal cords. A finder needle was placed through the anterior trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilaginous rings.  Once confirmed by bronchoscopy, a seldinger technique was used to serially dilate the tracheotomy over a wire and to place a # 7 cuffed shiley tracheostomy. The tracheostomy cuff was inflated. Cross table ventilation was performed and the tracheostomy placement was confirmed by bronchoscopy through the tracheostomy as well as CO2 return on the anesthesia monitor. The tracheostomy inner cannula was then placed. Surgicel was placed in the wound bed though hemostasis was great but plan to resume anticoagulation very shortly. The tracheostomy was secured with loose 2-0 prolene sutures to the skin and tracheostomy straps to maintain airway but prevent skin pressure injuries. The endotracheal tube was then withdrawn completely. The tracheostomy obturator was provided to the bedside care team. The patient remained in the ICU in critical condition. There were no complications.
 
At the end of the procedure, I contacted her husband Carl Pinell at 626-991-6311

Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appear normal. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for stenosis of the RML (75% patent). Diameter was 5-6 mm
Moderate clear secretions bilaterally, white thicker mucus eminating from RML. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
Endobronchial obstruction at RML was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7mm probe	 	30sec freeze-thaw cycles; total 6 applications	Ablation
 
Balloon dilation was performed at RML.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML.  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 75% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was successfully extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

1.	Left mainstem obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
1.	Left mainstem obstruction secondary to stricture and granulation tissue
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
CPT 31641: Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with destruction of tumor or relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg, laser therapy, cryotherapy)
Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with tracheal/bronchial dilation or closed reduction of fracture
CPT 31645 bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration
CPT 31502 Tracheotomy tube change
INDICATIONS:  Left mainstem obstruction
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the tracheoscomy tube removed and the stoma covered.  Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The tracheostomy stoma was mature without granulation tissue. There was no evidence of TE fistula. The tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental bronchi with findings notable for purulent secretions in the superior segment and basilar segments of the right lower lobe with mild extrinsic compression of the superior segment.  The left-sided airways were than inspected. The proximal and mid left mainstem was normal. In the distal aspect of the left mainstem there was an asymmetrical complex-appearing stricture with area of attached granulation tissue, on a stalk, moving in a ball valve motion with breathing resulting in approximately 90% obstruction.  At this point the only was removed and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator.  There is difficulty ventilating the patient with jet ventilation and oxygen saturation dropped requiring rigid bronchoscope to be removed and LMA replaced until saturation increase.  We then reinserted the rigid bronchoscope and had similar problems causing us to convert to closed ventilation with packing of the mouth and nose.  Once we are able to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation the FiO2 was decreased until exhaled FiO2 is less than 40% at which time the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope and an electrocautery snare was used to remove the area of granulation tissue without difficulty and there is only minimal bleeding.  Subsequently the electrocautery knife was used to make 2 incisions (2 and 6 o’clock) in the complex-appearing stricture (which is felt to likely be from unrecognized airway trauma at time of injury) after which a phase 8/9/10 Merritt dilatation balloon was used to gently dilate the airway to a maximum diameter of 10 mm.  At this point, the rigid bronchoscope was advanced to the distal left mainstem and inserted through the area of the stricture for further mechanical dilatation.  The rigid bronchoscope was then pulled back to the trachea and on repeat inspection with the flexible bronchoscope the post dilatational orifice was approximately 8 mm with orifice compromised by associated malacia.  There remains significant stricturing of the medial wall however decision was made not to further dilate or inserts sent at this time given plan for him to transfer to long-term neuro rehabilitation facility in Northern California in the next few days.  The rigid bronchoscope was then removed after which a fresh 6.0 cuffed fenestrated Shiley tracheostomy tube was reinserted through his stoma and attached to the ventilator.
Complications: None
Recommendations:
- Return to ICU for recovery 
- Will discuss case with interventional pulmonology at Stamford prior to the patient’s transfer to Palo Alto neuro rehabilitation facility, as repeat dilatation and possibly temporary stent placement will likely be required.

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions. We then removed the diagnostic Q190 bronchoscopy and the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the T190 therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we attempted to advance the 90 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement once at the point of interest with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view within the lesion. Biopsies were then performed with a variety of instruments to include peripheral needle, brush, triple needle brush and forceps, under fluoroscopic visualization.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful navigational biopsy of left upper lobe nodule.

1.	radial EBUS guided bronchoscopy with TNBA and endobronchial biopsies
2.	Bronchoscopic intubation 
Indications: Lung cancer with suspicion for recurrence 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. Somewhat thick secretions were seen throughout the airways. The left sided airway anatomy was normal without evidence of endobronchial disease. On the right the patient had an anatomic variant with an accessory airway just proximal to the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Within that segment fibrotic endoluminal obstruction was seen but all other airways did not have visual endobronchial disease to at least the first sub-segmental level. Due to difficulty with maintaining position of LMA (edentulous) the decision was made to convert to endotracheal intubation. This was performed over the bronchoscope without difficulty and the ETT was secured approximately 2 cm above the main carina. Once the ETT was connected to ventilator, The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted through the tube and advanced to the orifice of the accessory left lower lobe bronchus and the radial ultrasound was advanced through the scope into the sub-segment and a concentric view of the lesion was visualized within the segment. Multiple forceps biopsies were then performed. The lesion was extremely firm and samples were relatively scant. We then utilized the super-dimension 21G peripheral needle and the 19G Olympus peripheral needle to obtain a total of 6 endobronchial needle biopsies of the lesion which were placed in formalin. After adequate samples were obtained repeat inspection was performed and no evidence of bleeding or other complications were seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.  
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Flexible bronchoscopy with successful biopsy of left lower lobe accessory segment fibrotic endobronchial lesion.
- Await final pathology

IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required multiple modalities and increased effort to access and open the RML. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31629 TBNA single lobe   
31652 EBUS sampling 1 or 2 nodes
31630 Balloon dilation
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision . 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Flexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
  
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Not fully assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: RML orifice unable to be identified on initial inspection since the airway had swallowed up the prior RML stent and this was now fused shut. No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
VIEW OF OBLITERATED RML AND PATENT RLL FROM BRONCHUS INTERMEDIUS
 
PRIOR VIEW OF RML AND RLL FROM PRIOR BRONCHOSCOPY [REDACTED]
 
PRIOR VIEW OF RML AND RLL FROM PRIOR BRONCHOSCOPY [REDACTED] 
The RML was unable to be identified and there was suspicion that the RML stent migrated distally with overgrowth of tissue, effectively closing off the RML. The EBUS scope was utilized to identify the RML orifice and distal stent. Transbronchial needle aspiration was utilized to re-create/re-open the RML orifice. During this maneuver, frank pus was aspirated from the RML.
RML stent with needle within the airway:
 
Once an pinhole opening was made with above TBNA, pulmonary forceps were used to probe the RML and blunt dissect to widen the opening.
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RML.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology.
A 4Fr Fogarty balloon was inserted to further open the RML.  
Purulent secretions distal to the obstruction were aspirated. 
The hybrid scope was used to explore the distal RML and the medial and lateral subsegments were successfully identified.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2).  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
After above excision and dilation, the RML was finally patent and the stent could be visualized. 
VIEW OF RML AFTER RECANNALIZATION
 
VIEW OF DISTAL RML AFTER RECANNALIZATION
 
The foreign body/old stent (iCAST 7mm x 16mm) was identified and grasped with the pulmonary rat tooth forceps. This was removed en bloc with the bronchoscope.
Bleeding/oozing was noted from the RML and this was treated with multiple modalities including cold saline, TXA, epinephrine, and electrocautery/coagulation.
Endobronchial debris and hemorrhage at RML was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	Probe 	Forced coag	2-5sec	Ablation/Coagulation
 
In effort to prevent stent from getting swallowed up again, a longer stent was selected. Next, an iCAST 7mm x 22mm stent was deployed into the RML however this blocked off the RLL and was subsequently removed en bloc with the bronchoscope using the rat tooth forceps.
An iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent was placed in the RML but was noted to be too proximal and was subsequently removed en bloc with the bronchoscope using the rat tooth forceps.
Another iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent was placed in the RML and seated appropriately. 
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2) through the stent to seat the stent.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds.
RML stent at end of case:
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent (path)
--RML BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway stenosis. The patient's RML was closed off around his iCAST stent. The RML was reopened and the stent was removed. A new iCAST stent (7mm x 16mm) was placed. Patient tolerated the procedure and there were no immediate complications.
--Follow-up path and BAL results
--Repeat bronchoscopy in 2 weeks for re-evaluation
--Augmentin (875mg-125mg) 1 tab by mouth twice daily for 7 days

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_127 SOURCE_FILE: note_127.txt Patient name: [REDACTED]

Preoperative diagnosis: 1:DLBCL - diffuse large B cell lymphoma
Postoperative diagnosis: same as above

Procedures performed:
31622 – Bronchoscopy, flexible, with or without fluoroscopic guidance, diagnostic
CPT 31652 bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided transtracheal and/or transbronchial sampling 2 or fewer structures.

Indications for the procedure: peripheral nodule

Anesthesia: General anesthesia using a #8.5 endotracheal tube.

Procedure: After obtaining informed consent from the patient,_was brought to the procedure room. A proper timeout was performed to identify the correct patient and procedure to be performed. General anesthesia was administered to the patient and_was orally intubated with a 8.5 ETT by the anesthesia team. the H190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords were normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.

The UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 7 lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 21 gauge needle beginning with the 7 Lymph node, 5 biopsies were performed in each station. ROSE evaluation yielded mostly nondiagnostic neutrophil/blood. Following sample from the 7 station, transvascular needle aspiration was performed of station 5 using a 21-gauge and 25-gauge needle for total of 3 passes through the pulmonary artery. Samples from station 5 appeared bloody under microscopic evaluation. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the H1 90 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Lymph nodes

7: >15mm; 6of passes
5: 4.7 mm; 6 passes

Following confirmation of hemostasis and therapeutic aspiration of all endobronchial secretions, the bronchoscope was removed. Patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. Patient was extubated and returned to recovery in good condition.

Specimens:
Cytology
Cell count
Bacterial culture
Fungal culture
Acid Fast culture
flow cytometry

EBL: minimal

Bronchoscopes: Olympus H190, UC180F EBUS
