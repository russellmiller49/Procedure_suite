PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  Thin rusty secretions, therapeutic aspiration was done.  Cavity noted in the RB2 subsegment. 
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Endobronchial balloon at ligula, LUL with organized clot obscuring evaluation of distal airways. Otherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology. 7Fr Ardnt blocker was noted in middle of LMS. Balloon deflated. 
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
Blocker (foreign body) was removed under direct visualization without any additional bleeding. 
 
New Uniblocker (5Fr) balloon occlusion was performed at the Left Carina (LC2) with 5 Fr Uniblocker and secured in place with the Uniblocker ventilator adaptor.
            -Placed at the tape level at dark blue securement device
            -Confirmed that 3cc of air was required to inflate the balloon to fully occlude the 
LUL
The endobronchial blocker balloon was left inflated in the LUL.  With balloon inflated, the following was performed. 
 
Endobronchial clot at LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1) and Left Carina (LC2) was treated with the following modalities:
 
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Cryoprobe	1.7mm Cryoprobe	N/A	5-10 second freezes	Excellent clot removal
 
After organized clot was removed from the LUL orifice.  
 
When block balloon was deflated, additional fresh blood was noted coming from LB1/2.  The blocker was reinflated with 3cc of air with cessation of bleeding. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

NOTE_ID:  note_237 SOURCE_FILE: note_237.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: lung cancer with complete left mainstem stenosis. 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Resolved mainstem obstruction s/p areo stent
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with Aero tracheobronchial stent placement in the left mainstem
INDICATIONS: Obstruction of left mainstem bronchus
Consent was obtained from the family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the posterior oropharynx. The ETT was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced past the vocal cords into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. Airway inspection was performed and the tracheal and right sided airways were normal. At the proximal aspect of the left mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing complete obstruction of the airway. Using the 2.4 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract portions of the tumor slowly and further extraction was performed using utilized APC and flexible forceps to “burn and shave” the remaining until eventually the LC1 carina was seen. In the left upper lobe the airways appeared normal without evidence of tumor while in the left lower lobe mucosal tumor invasion was present but non-obstructive to at least the first subsegments. Although we were able to debulk the majority of tumor in the mainstem there remained significant residual tumor burden causing partial airway obstruction and it was decided to place and Aero SEMS to maintain patency and for barrier effect. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope into the left lower lobe past the mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation. The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted and the stent was evaluated and was in appropriate position with a residual airway of >90% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and bronchoscopic intubation was performed with an 8.0 ETT and the procedure was completed.
Recommendations:
-          Transfer back to ICU
-          Post-procedure x-ray
-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.
-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31630 Balloon dilation
 
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at Bronchus Intermedius .  Two areas were biopsied with NBI guidance.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.
 
Stents are in good position.  The (iCAST 7x16) was noted in the right lower airway.  (iCAST 5x16) was noted in the right middle lobe airway. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at RLL.  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
Balloon dilation was performed at RB2 orifice.  5mm mustang balloon was used to perform dilation to 5mm at the RB2.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
Radial EBUS
Ion Robotic Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
CT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target.   The navigational plan was reviewed and verified.  This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
Ventilation Parameters:
Mode	RR	TV	PEEP	FiO2	Flow Rate	Pmean
vcv	14	400	12	100	10	15
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform.  Partial registration was used.    Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of RUL (RB3).  Target lesion is about 1 cm in diameter.   Under navigational guidance the ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. 
Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the nodule is Eccentric.  The following features were noted: Continuous margin .
Cone Beam CT was performed: 3-D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation.  Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location.  Low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.  This was passed on to Ion platform system for reconstruction and nodule location.  The 3D images was interpreted on an independent workstation (Ion).   Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.   I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction. 
Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G Needle through the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), Cytology, and flow cytometry.
Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps the extended working channel catheter.  Total 6 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Pathology.
Transbronchial brushing was performed with Protected cytology brush the extended working channel catheter.  Total 1 samples were collected.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed the extended working channel catheter.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Cytology.
Fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Prior to withdraw of the bronchoscope. 
Prior to withdrawal of the bronchoscope, inspection demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.
EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle.
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 4R (lower paratracheal) node
4L (lower paratracheal) node
7 (subcarinal) node
11Rs lymph node
11L lymph node
No immediate complications
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy. 
Lymph Nodes Evaluated:
Site 1: The 11L lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
Site 2: The 7 (subcarinal) node was => 10 mm on CT and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was sampled.. 4 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. Despite the benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm the absence of malignancy and to obtain cytology for diagnostic completeness.
Site 3: The 4L (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
Site 4: The 4R (lower paratracheal) node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
Site 5: The 11Rs lymph node was < 10 mm on CT  and Metabolic activity unknown or PET-CT scan unavailable. The lymph node was photographed. The site was not sampled: Sampling this lymph node was not clinically indicated.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Etomidate30mg
Rocuronium80mg
Propofol gtt50 mcg/kg/min
Fentanyl gtt150 mcg/hr
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   1326
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   1520
 
Total moderate sedation time was 114 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by ICU RN. 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Diagnostic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The endotracheal tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
Neck Ultrasound was performed to evaluate for any abnormal vessel, mass, structures at the site of percutaneous tracheostomy.  There were no significant vessels/mass were noted overlying the tracheostomy site on examination from the laryngeal prominence to the sternal notch.  
 
 
 
 
 
The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization.  The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized.  Next, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% 3ml ml was injected into the anterior neck.  A 1 cm incision was made horizontally with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.  Suture (3-0 prolene) was placed around the incision site to create a Rummel tourniquet.  The introducer needle was then passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization. Next, a J-wire was passed through the catheter, also visualized with the bronchoscope.  The site was then dilated using the 14Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire.  
 
The 14 Fr dilator was then removed from the guide wire and an 8 Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level.  The tissue dilator was placed over the guiding catheter until the positioning mark was visualized via the bronchoscope.  The tissue dilator was then removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
 
Finally a Shiley 8.0 cuffed tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization.  The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were then removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place.  This was confirmed to be in good position bronchoscopically.  The Endotracheal tube was then removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube.   Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding.  A Lyofoam drain sponge was placed under the tracheostomy tube prior to suturing into place.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications. The staff physician was present throughout the entire procedure. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition.

NOTE_ID:  note_187 SOURCE_FILE: note_187.txt Procedure Name: EBUS bronchoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage
Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy and interstitial lung disease 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. Ultrasound was utilized to identify and measure the radiographically enlarged station 7, 4R and 11Rs lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the station 4R lymph node, followed by the station 7 lymph node and finally the 4L lymph node using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Rapid onsite evaluation read as benign lymphoid tissue in all sampled nodes. All samples were sent for routine cytology and flow cytometry. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy the video bronchoscope was re-inserted and blood was suctioned from the airway. Using fluoroscopy transbronchial forceps lung biopsies were performed in both the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. Finally BAL was performed with 120cc instillation and 40cc return. Prior to removing the bronchoscope an airway examination was performed and no evidence of active bleeding was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and procedure completed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful EBUS bronchoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage 
- Will await final pathology and culture results

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_129 SOURCE_FILE: note_129.txt Procedure Performed:
Right-sided medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and chest tube insertion

Indication:
Exudative pleural effusion

Medications:
Moderate sedation per anesthesia record

Topical Anesthesia:
Lidocaine 1%, 20 mL

The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Pertinent laboratory studies and imaging were reviewed. A procedural time-out was performed.

The patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position on the procedural bed, with pressure points appropriately padded. The right-sided pleural entry site was identified using ultrasound guidance. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (ChloraPrep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry site was infiltrated with 20 mL of 1% lidocaine. A 1-cm skin incision was made, and blunt dissection was carried down to the pleural space. Finger sweep revealed pleural adhesions, which were lysed bluntly.

An 8-mm disposable primary port was placed in the right fourth intercostal space at the mid-axillary line. After air entrainment and lung deflation, an Olympus semi-rigid pleuroscope was introduced through the trocar into the pleural cavity. Suction was applied, and approximately 1,600 mL of serosanguinous pleural fluid was removed.

The pleura appeared abnormal, with areas of isolated nodularity and plaques most consistent with pachypleuritis. No significant adhesions were present. Multiple biopsies of abnormal posterior parietal pleura were obtained using forceps. Additionally, a large pleural specimen was obtained using an electrocautery knife. Approximately nine total biopsies were obtained and sent for histopathological examination. Minimal bleeding was observed.

Following biopsies, talc pleurodesis was performed using a combination of talc poudrage and talc slurry, with a total of 5 grams of talc instilled. The primary port was then removed, and a 24-French chest tube was placed through the existing stoma, sutured in place, and connected to a pleuro-vac. The chest tube was dressed and covered with a transparent dressing.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.

A post-procedure chest radiograph demonstrated the chest tube in appropriate position, with the proximal side hole just at the pleural wall and a trace apical pneumothorax.

Complications:
None immediate

Estimated Blood Loss:
10 mL

Post-Procedure Diagnosis:
Pleural effusion

Recommendations:

Admit to inpatient service (planned)

Chest tube to suction; plan for removal once output is <150 mL/day

Pain management following talc pleurodesis, including narcotics as needed

Await pathology results

Inpatient Interventional Pulmonology consult team to follow

Total moderate sedation time was 83 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by ICU RN. 
 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology. Uniblocker in place (deflated) at LMSB
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Moderate bloody secretions with left greater than right
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
Amphotericin 50mg in 20cc sterile water was instilled into the LUL with 10cc into the apico-posterior (LB1/2) subsegment and 10cc into the anterior (LB3) subsegment
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--None
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 33 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for instillation of Amphotericin. Patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.

PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Normal.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Mildly tortuous
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: The distal left mainstem bronchus was noted to be slightly stenotic (~8mm). Otherwise, there was normal anatomic branching to segmental level in the LLL, noting historic obliteration of LUL.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
DISTAL LEFT MAINSTEM BRONCHUS
 ]
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
On PEEP 0, the patient's airways were noted to have slight malacia <50% at the proximal and distal left mainstem bronchus.
 
MALACIA AT PROXIMAL LMSB

MALACIA AT DISTAL LMSB

DISTAL LMSB WITH AND WITHOUT PEEP (left and right, respectively)
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--LLL BAL (cell count, micro)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 22 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway stenosis. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
 
--Follow up BAL results
--Repeat bronchoscopy in 4 weeks for possible dilation, stenting
