NOTE_ID:  note_128 SOURCE_FILE: note_128.txt Patient name:  [REDACTED]

Preoperative diagnosis: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; Cough; Esophageal cancer; Malignant esophageal tumor; Pneumonia
Postoperative diagnosis: Same as above with addition of significant carcinomatosis and lymphangitic/metastatic spread of patient's malignancy causing severe and near complete obstruction primarily affecting the right lung.

Procedures performed:
31622 – Bronchoscopy, flexible, with or without fluoroscopic guidance, diagnostic
Balloon Dilation, 31630, Bronchoscopy rigid or flexible including fluoroscopic guidance when performed; with tracheal/bronchial dilation

Indications for the procedure: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; Cough; Esophageal cancer; Malignant esophageal tumor; Pneumonia

Anesthesia: General anesthesia using a #8.5endotracheal tube.

Procedure: After obtaining informed consent from the patient, the patient was brought to the procedure room. A proper timeout was performed to identify the correct patient and procedure to be performed. General anesthesia was administered.

Rigid bronchoscopy was performed with an 11mm ventilating scope. The patient, however, desaturated quickly despite relatively high driving pressures on jet ventilation (to the 60s), requiring extubation. The patient was bagged to bring saturations up and we intubated with the rigid scope again, but had the same thing happen. We then intubated with an 8.5 ETT and proceeded.

The T190/P190 video bronchoscope was introduced and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. There was significant adenopathy surrounding the vocal cords; however, patent vocal cords were noted on exam with mild erythema of the trachea following advancement. Left lung without any apparent superficial abnormality, other than secretions noted in the bilateral airway. Right lung with significant swelling, edema, erythema, and nodularity noted throughout, most prominently in the right middle and right lower lobe with significant secretions aspirated and near complete obstruction and narrowing of the airways.

We dilated the lower airway with an 8-9-10mm Elation balloon to better bypass the proximal tumor before assessing the distal disease. The dilation was temporary only, and collapse recurred.

Unfortunately, as we advanced past the proximal tumor obstruction with the P190 flexible bronchoscope, we could see tumor infiltration extending into all of the distal subsegments, making no appropriate landing point for stenting. We decided to terminate the procedure as the airway was not salvageable.

He was then taken to the ICU intubated.
Specimens: None

EBL: minimal

Bronchoscopes: Diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscope as well as rigid bronchoscope

NOTE TEXT:

NOTE_ID:  note_136 SOURCE_FILE: note_136.txt Procedure Performed:
Flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound–guided transbronchial needle aspiration

Indication:
Diagnostic evaluation and mediastinal staging

Medications:
General anesthesia
Topical anesthesia: Lidocaine 2%, 10 mL to the tracheobronchial tree

The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Pertinent laboratory studies and imaging were reviewed. A procedural time-out was performed.

Following administration of intravenous medications per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, a Q180 slim video bronchoscope was introduced orally via a laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. Subsequently, a UC180F convex-probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced orally via the laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Airway Examination

The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords moved normally with respiration. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber, and the carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal, with no endobronchial lesions or significant secretions. A bronchial stump was noted without evidence of recurrence.

Endobronchial Ultrasound Findings and Sampling

The bronchoscope was withdrawn and replaced with the EBUS bronchoscope to perform ultrasound evaluation. A systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node survey was conducted.

Lymph node sizing and sampling were performed for non–small cell lung cancer staging using an Olympus 22-gauge EBUS-TBNA needle. Samples were obtained from the following stations and sent for routine cytology:

Station 4L (left lower paratracheal):
Measured 4.6 mm by EBUS and 5 mm by CT; PET negative. On ultrasound, the lymph node appeared hypoechoic, heterogeneous, irregularly shaped, with sharp margins. The node was biopsied using a 22-gauge needle. A total of five needle passes were obtained. Rapid on-site evaluation indicated adequate tissue.

Station 5 (subaortic):
Measured 20.7 mm by EBUS and 24.1 mm by CT; PET positive. This node was accessed via the esophagus and biopsy was technically challenging. On ultrasound, the lymph node appeared hypoechoic, heterogeneous, irregularly shaped, with sharp margins. The node was biopsied using a 22-gauge needle. A total of eight needle passes were obtained. Rapid on-site evaluation was suspicious for malignancy.

All samples were submitted to cytopathology for review.

Complications:
None immediate

Estimated Blood Loss:
<5 mL

Post-Procedure Diagnosis:

Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration

Normal endobronchial examination

Mediastinal lymph node sampling performed

Disposition:
The patient remained stable and was transferred in good condition to the bronchoscopy recovery area, where he will be observed until discharge criteria are met. Preliminary findings were discussed with the patient. Follow-up with the requesting service for final pathology results was recommended.

Recommendations:

Await cytology results

Consider CT-guided biopsy if EBUS sampling is nondiagnostic

NOTE_ID:  note_087 SOURCE_FILE: note_087.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a Pt with transplant stenosis that required 4 balloon dilations and 6 applications of cryo . This resulted in >50% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy). 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: supine
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appear normal. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for stenosis of the RML (75% patent). Diameter was 5-6 mm
Moderate clear secretions bilaterally, white thicker mucus eminating from RML. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
Endobronchial obstruction at RML was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7mm probe	 	30sec freeze-thaw cycles; total 6 applications	Ablation
 
Balloon dilation was performed at RML.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML.  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 75% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was successfully extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

NOTE_ID:  note_195 SOURCE_FILE: note_195.txt Procedure Name: Pleuroscopy
Indications: Pleural effusion
Medications: Fentanyl 3, versed 75, Lidocaine 30cc 1%
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the L lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  An 8 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. There was diffuse pleural studding observed. The pleura was gernerally unremarkable with the execution of a few white and yellow plaques as well as some mild tethering of the right upper lobe to the chest wall. Biopsies of the abnormal areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with forceps and sent for histopathology examination with approximately 5 total biopsies taken. There was brisk but transient bleeding after the initial biopsy ans subsequently protamine was given to completely reverse patients heparin (which was held for the procedure). The pleuroscopy telescope was then removed and a 15.5 pleural catheter was placed into the pleural space through the primary port with tunneling anteriorly. 

PleurX Catheter Placement:

A guide wire was inserted into the site of pleuroscopy entry and the port was removed. A separate skin site was identified ~5cm inferior to the guidewire insertion site and lidocaine was injected for local analgesia and a <1cm incision was then performed. A subcutaneous tract was then established to the guidewire insertion site with the provided blunt tunneler.  The Pleurx catheter was attached to the tunneler and pulled through the subcutaneous tract, followed by dilatation of the pleural access tract with the 16 fr peel away sheath via seldinger technique. The Pleurx catheter was then inserted through the 16 fr. peel away sheath. Both incisions were closed with subcuticular 0 silk suture. The area was then dressed. The catheter was subsequently connected to the drainage wall suction and <100cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained.  The catheter tip was then capped and the pleurx was dressed and covered with a transulent dressing. 

The patient tolerated the procedural well.
Post-procedure chest radiograph showed minimal residual pleural air with
pleural catheter in place tracking upwards.  
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 20cc
Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion 
Recommendation:
Will await pathology and microbiological studies
Patient education on pleural catheter draining and will return tomorrow for initial drainage.
Hold heparin drip until 6 hours post-procedure (19:00 tonight)

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_167 SOURCE_FILE: note_167.txt Indications: Mediastinal adenopathy in setting of known lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Right sided bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; without endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. Left proximal left mainstem was normal. There was submucosal tumor infiltration in the distal 3 cm of the left mainstem circumferentially. The left lower lobe was completely obstructed by endobronchial tumor. The left upper lobe orifice was approximately 70% obstructed with tumor and the LC1 carina was infiltrated with tumor. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 7, 4L lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 7 Lymph node, followed by the 4L lymph node. ROSE evaluation yielded benign lymphocytes in the station 7 and scant lymphocytes in station 4L. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.
Decision was made to not proceed with mediastinoscopy as the left mainstem and upper lobe disease would preclude previously considered surgical resection and treatment would not be effected by the presence of N2 disease. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5cc

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results
- Will present at tumor board for consideration of chemo-rads

NOTE_ID:  note_197 SOURCE_FILE: note_197.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse parenchymal lung disease
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse parenchymal lung disease 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with transbronchial cryobiopsy, 
INDICATIONS: Diffuse parenchymal lung disease
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After receiving analgesia and paralytics the patient was bag masked and once preoxygenated a 12 mm rigid tracheoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. After inspection bronchoscopy which was unremarkable a BAL was performed in the right middle lobe. Subsequentlya Forgery balloon was inserted to the rigid bronchoscope into the anterior segment of the right lower lobe. Under fluoroscopic guidance the cryoprobe was inserted past the balloon into the lateral left lower lobe segment under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the pleural margin was reached the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds at which time the flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were removed en-bloc in the Fogarty balloon was inflated immediately after removal. One specimen was removed from the cryoprobe the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. No blood was noted and this was repeated for a total of 6 biopsies. Once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed.  Following completion of the procedure fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to evaluate for pneumothorax and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was subsequently removed once the patient was able to breathe spontaneously.

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_091 SOURCE_FILE: note_091.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
31630 Balloon dilation
31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The endotracheal tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for mildly tortuous airways as before, intact anastomoses bilaterally. The RML orifice was ~75% narrowed with combination of weblike stenosis and pedunculated granulation tissue. Mild secretions bilaterally but with thick purulent secretions eminating from the RML. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Bronchus Intermedius  and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RML.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
Balloon dilation was performed at RML.  Mustang 4mm balloon was used to perform dilation to 4 mm at the RML.  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Balloon dilation was performed at RML.  Mustang 6/7/8 balloon was used to perform dilation to 6 and 7 mm at the RML.  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at RML.  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Endobronchial obstruction at RML was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	 	 	 	 
APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	1.7mm probe	 	30sec freeze thaw cycles	Ablation 
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 25% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
- RML EBBx (micro)
- RML BAL
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial stenosis of the RML. Ongoing recurrence of stenosis, currently on stent holiday. Will need ongoing close vigilance of the airway due to tendency to fuse shut. 
- f/u BAL results
- repeat bronch in 2 weeks for dilation

NOTE_ID:  note_096 SOURCE_FILE: note_096.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31615 Visualization of windpipe (Tracheobronchoscopy through established tracheostomy incision)
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The airway was inspected via the tracheostomy tube. Lidocaine was applied to the airway.
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus and mucus plug. 
Secretions were cleared. 
The airway anatomy demonstrated improvement of the yellow necrotic tissue. It remains present, but less prominent. 
The right middle lobe stent was partially occluded with mucus this was rinsed with saline and cleaned. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
None
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure.

NOTE_ID:  note_162 SOURCE_FILE: note_162.txt Procedure Name: EBUS Bronchoscopy
Indications: lung cancer diagnosis and staging (left upper lobe tumor)
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure performed:
: 31653 bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided transbronchial sampling > 2 structures.
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
 Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, except for in the left lower lobe in which the proximal origin was mildly extrinsically compressed.  The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11Rs (6.7mm), 10R (5.7mm), 4R (9.1mm), 2R (7.1 mm), 7 (15.7mm), 4L (6.9mm),  and 11L (21.1mm)  lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11Rs Lymph node followed by 7, and 4R, 2R lymph nodes using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE showed malignant cells in the 4R and 2R station consistent with N3 disease. We then moved to the large 11L lymph node and took 8 additional passes for molecular studies. All samples were sent for routine cytology and a dedicated pass from the 11L was sent for flow cytometry. The Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 5 cc.

Post Procedure Recommendations:
- Transfer to post-procedure unit and home per protocol
- Will await final pathology results

NOTE: note_147
================================================================================

NOTE TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE_ID:  note_147 SOURCE_FILE: note_147.txt Procedure Performed:
Left-sided pleuroscopy (medical thoracoscopy) with pleural fluid drainage, pleural biopsies, and tunneled pleural catheter placement

Indication:
Pleural effusion

Medications / Anesthesia:
Monitored anesthesia care

Pre-Anesthesia Assessment:

ASA Class III (severe systemic disease)

The procedure, including risks, benefits, and alternatives, was explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained and documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Pertinent laboratory studies and imaging were reviewed. A procedural time-out was performed.

The patient was positioned in the lateral decubitus position on the operating table with pressure points appropriately padded. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (ChloraPrep) and draped in the usual fashion.

Local Anesthesia

The pleural entry site was identified using ultrasound guidance. The entry site was infiltrated with 20 mL of 1% lidocaine.

Procedure Description

A 10-mm reusable primary port was placed on the left side at the sixth intercostal space in the mid-axillary line using a Veress needle technique. A 10.0-mm integrated pleuroscope was introduced through the incision and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was inspected via the primary port.

A total of approximately 1,700 mL of amber-colored pleural fluid was removed.

Findings

The pleura demonstrated multiple areas of visible tumor studding involving the parietal pleura, visceral pleura, and lung. The left lower lobe did not appear fully expanded and was atelectatic.

Biopsies

Biopsies of pleural tumor studding over the diaphragm were obtained using forceps and sent for histopathological examination. A total of 11 biopsies were obtained.

Pleural Catheter Placement

A 15.5-French PleurX catheter was placed in the pleural space over the diaphragm.

Dressing

The port site was dressed with a transparent dressing.

Complications:
None immediate

Estimated Blood Loss:
Minimal

Post-Procedure Diagnosis:
Suspected pleural metastasis

Post-Procedure Plan:

Observe post-procedure until discharge criteria are met

Obtain post-procedure chest radiograph
