Example A: Navigation failure (Modifier -53)
Header: Robotic navigation bronchoscopy
Body: Navigation attempted, but mis-registration occurred and conversion to standard bronchoscopy was required. Unable to navigate to target.

Example B: Radial vs linear EBUS
Radial EBUS was used with concentric view of the lesion. No mediastinal stations were sampled.

Example C: Airway dilation false positive
The subcutaneous tissues were dilated to place the chest tube.

Example D: IPC vs chest tube
A 14Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain was placed for pneumothorax. No tunneled catheter was inserted.

Example E: Rigid bronchoscopy header/body conflict
Header: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debulking
Body: The flexible bronchoscope was advanced to the segmental bronchi and inspection was completed.
